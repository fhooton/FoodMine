0.91,10917927,"Procyanidins are a subclass of flavonoids found in commonly consumed foods that have attracted increasing attention due to their potential health benefits. However, little is known regarding their dietary intake levels because detailed quantitative information on the procyanidin profiles present in many food products is lacking. Therefore, the procyanidin content of red wine, chocolate, cranberry juice and four varieties of apples has been determined. On average, chocolate and apples contained the largest procyanidin content per serving (164.7 and 147.1 mg, respectively) compared with red wine and cranberry juice (22.0 and 31.9 mg, respectively). However, the procyanidin content varied greatly between apple samples (12.3-252.4 mg/serving) with the highest amounts on average observed for the Red Delicious (207.7 mg/serving) and Granny Smith (183.3 mg/serving) varieties and the lowest amounts in the Golden Delicious (92.5 mg/serving) and McIntosh (105.0 mg/serving) varieties.

Considering this representative samples (69) of candies and chocolates based on cocoa, milk and sugar were analyzed for selected heavy metals by means of flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The average concentration of Zn, Pb, Ni, and Cd was found to be 2.52 _± 2.49, 2.0 _± 1.20, 0.84 _± 1.35, and 0.17 _± 0.22 __g/g respectively. Results indicate that cocoa-based candies have higher metal content than milk- or sugar-based candies. The daily dietary intake of metals for children eating candies and chocolates was also calculated, and results indicated highest intake of Pb and Zn followed by Ni, Cd, and Cu. Comparison of the current study results with other studies around the globe shows that the heavy metal content in candies and chocolates is lower in India than reported elsewhere.

In the improved method, the interfering cocoa pigments are effectively removed by passing the aqueous extract through a Sep-pak C(18) cartridge. Subsequent injection on a C(18) reverse-phase column employing acetonitrile and water (20:80) as the mobile phase reduces the analysis time without affecting either resolution of the peak or the accuracy of caffeine and theobromine determination or achieving baseline resolution.

Furthermore, the method was easier to use than other methods available in the literature. For aflatoxin extraction from cocoa samples, a methanol-water solution was used, and then immunoaffinity columns were employed for clean-up before the determination by high-performance liquid chromatography. A survey demonstrated a widespread occurrence of aflatoxins in cocoa by-products, although in general the levels of aflatoxins present in the fractions from industrial processing of cocoa were low. A maximum aflatoxin contamination of 13.3 ng g(-1) was found in a nib sample. The lowest contamination levels were found in cocoa butter.

The determination of copper in chocolate is important because copper compounds are extensively used as fungicides in the farming of cocoa. In this paper, a slurry-sampling flame atomic-absorption spectrometric method is proposed for determination of copper in powdered chocolate samples. Optimization was carried out using univariate methodology involving the variables nature and concentration of the acid solution for slurry preparation, sonication time, and sample mass. The recommended conditions include a sample mass of 0.2 g, 2.0 mol L(-1) hydrochloric acid solution, and a sonication time of 15 min. The calibration curve was prepared using aqueous copper standards in 2.0 mol L(-1) hydrochloric acid. This method allowed determination of copper in chocolate with a detection limit of 0.4 microg g(-1) and precision, expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD), of 2.5% (n = 10) for a copper content of approximately 30 microg g(-1), using a chocolate mass of 0.2 g. The accuracy was confirmed by analyzing the certified reference materials NIST SRM 1568a rice flour and NIES CRM 10-b rice flour. The proposed method was used for determination of copper in three powdered chocolate samples, the copper content of which varied between 26.6 and 31.5 microg g(-1).

One novel technique for producing UTLC plates has been glancing angle deposition (GLAD), a physical vapor deposition technique capable of aligning macropores to produce interesting separation properties. To date, however, GLAD-UTLC plates have been restricted to model dye systems, rather than realistic analytes. This study demonstrates the transfer of high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) sugar analysis methods to GLAD-UTLC plates using the office chromatography framework. A consumer inkjet printer was used to apply very sharp low volume (3-30__nL) bands of water-soluble analytes (lactose, sucrose, and fructose). Analytic performance measurements extrapolated the limits of detection to be 3-5__ng/zone, which was experimentally proven down to 60-70__ng/band, depending on the sugar. This qualitative analysis of sugars in a commercially available chocolate sample is the first reported application of GLAD-UTLC to food samples. The potential utility of GLAD-UTLC is further exemplified by successful coupling with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry for the first time to characterize underivatized sugars.

This method was applied to flavanol determination in 56 different kinds of Spanish food products, including fruit, vegetables, legumes, beverages (cider, coffee, beer, tea, and wine), and chocolate. The determined compounds corresponded to the catechins and proanthocyanidin dimers and trimers usually present in food and, therefore, they were representative of the flavanols of low degree of polymerization consumed with the diet. The data generated could be used for calculation of the dietary intake of either individual or total flavanols, which would allow the further establishment of epidemiological correlations with the incidence of chronic diseases. Similar flavanol profiles were found in the different samples of a similar type of product, even though important variations could exist in the concentrations of total and individual flavanols among them. This was attributed to factors such as sample origin, stage of ripeness, post-harvesting conservation, and processing. Total flavanol contents varied from nondetectable in most of the vegetables to 184 mg/100 g found in a sample of broad bean. Substantial amounts were also found in some fruits, such as plum and apple, as well as in tea and red wine. Epicatechin was the most abundant flavanol, followed by catechin and procyanidin B2.

Metabolomics has been proposed as a powerful tool to characterize both the intake and the effects on the metabolism of dietary components. Human urine metabolome modifications after single cocoa intake were explored in a randomized, crossed, and controlled trial. After overnight fasting, 10 subjects consumed randomly either a single dose of cocoa powder with milk or water, or milk without cocoa. Urine samples were collected before the ingestion and at 0-6, 6-12, and 12-24-h after test-meals consumption. Samples were analyzed by HPLC-q-ToF, followed by multivariate data analysis. Results revealed an important effect on urinary metabolome during the 24 h after cocoa powder intake. These changes were not influenced by matrix as no global differences were found between cocoa powder consumption with milk or with water. Overall, 27 metabolites related to cocoa-phytochemicals, including alkaloid derivatives, polyphenol metabolites (both host and microbial metabolites) and processing-derived products such as diketopiperazines, were identified as the main contributors to the urinary modifications after cocoa powder intake.

Since human exposure to aflatoxins occurs primarily by contaminated food intake, and given the greater susceptibility of infants to their adverse effects, the quantification of these mycotoxins in infant food based on cereals is of relevance. Aflatoxin levels were determined in 91 Spanish infant cereals classified in terms of non- and organically produced and several types from 10 different manufacturers, using a extraction procedure followed by inmunoaffinity column clean-up step and HPLC with fluorescence detection (FLD) and post-column derivatisation (Kobra Cell system). Daily aflatoxin intake was also assessed. Preliminary analysis showed a valuable incidence of detected infant cereal samples at an upper concentration level than the detection limit for total aflatoxin (66%), corresponding to a 46, 40, 34 and 11% for AFB1, AFB2, AFG1 and AFG2, respectively. Lower aflatoxin values (median, Q1, Q3) in conventional infant cereal (n = 74, AFB1: <LOD (n.d.; 0.02), AFB2: n.d. (n.d.; 0.01), AFG1: <LOD (n.d.; 0.004), and AFG2: n.d.

In addition, five organic formulations (3.11, 1.98, 0.94, 0.47 and 0.21 _µg kg(-1)) exceeded European AFB1 legislation (0.10 _µg kg(-1)) versus two conventional cereals (0.35 and 0.12 _µg kg(-1)). According to the type of infant cereal, those with cocoa had the highest aflatoxin levels. Gluten-free and cereals with dehydrated fruits had an intermediate level and milk- or honey-based cereals and multi-cereals contained the lowest levels. With the exception of the non-compliant cocoa-based organic formulation, none of the infant cereals analyzed gave a higher intake of 1 ng kg(-1) body weight per day, suggesting that infants fed on infant cereals are exposed to a low health hazard.

Barley, with sorghum, rice, and wheat, are the only cereals that contain these compounds. Because of that, two barley genotypes, named waxy and non-waxy, were analyzed by normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection-mass spectrometry (NP-HPLC-FLD-MS). Total proanthocyanidin content ranged between 293.2 and 652.6 __g/g of flour. Waxy samples reported the highest content (p < 0.05) of proanthocyanidins. Dimer compounds were the principal proanthocyanidin constituents of barley samples. Moreover, the possibility to use near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy as a rapid method to discriminate between waxy and non-waxy samples and to predict quantitatively proanthocyanidins in barley samples was evaluated. Partial least squares (PLS) models were built to predict the proanthocyanidin constituent, obtaining determination coefficients (R(2)) ranging from 0.92 to 0.97, in test set validation. Because of that, this study highlights that NIR spectroscopy technology with multivariate calibration analysis could be successfully applied as a rapid method to determine proanthocyanidin content in barley.

0.77,11404845,"Rapid analysis of molecular mass distributions of triacylglycerol (TAG) mixtures and regioisomeric structures of selected molecular mass species is possible using ammonia negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry utilizing sample introduction by direct exposure probe. However, interpretation of spectra and calculation of results is time consuming, thus lengthening the total analysis time. To facilitate result calculation a software package (MSPECTRA 1.3) was developed and applied to automatic processing of triacylglycerol molecular mass distribution spectra and collision induced dissociation (CID) product ion spectra. The program is capable of identifying triacylglycerol molecular mass species possessing different ACN:DB (acyl carbon number:number of double bonds) ratios on the basis of m/z values of [M - H](-) ions. In addition to such identification the program also corrects spectra for abundances of naturally occurring (13)C isotopes and calculates relative proportions of triacylglycerol molecular species in the analyzed samples. If several replicate spectra are processed simultaneously the program automatically calculates an average and standard deviation of relative proportions of molecular species. In the case of CID spectra the program identifies fatty acid fragment ions [RCO(2)](-) and the corresponding [M - H - RCO(2)H - 100](-) ions, and calculates the relative proportions of ions in both groups. These proportions are then used automatically to calculate the fatty acid combinations comprising the parent triacylglycerol molecule and the regiospecific positions of fatty acids. Processing of several replicate product ion spectra simultaneously produces averaged proportions of regioisomers comprising the parent triacylglycerol molecular species and the standard deviation of the analysis. The performance of the program was tested by analyzing triacylglycerol samples of human milk, human milk substitutes, human chylomicron and cocoa butter, and by comparing results obtained by automated processing of the data with manually calculated results.",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D000641', 'D001331', 'D002914', 'D003627', 'D004041', 'D006801', 'D008895', 'D008970', 'D012984', 'D018629', 'D013237', 'D014280']","['Ammonia', 'Automation', 'Chylomicrons', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Dietary Fats', 'Humans', 'Milk, Human', 'Molecular Weight', 'Software', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Triglycerides']",Software (MSPECTRA) for automatic interpretation of triacylglycerol molecular mass distribution spectra and collision induced dissociation product ion spectra obtained by ammonia negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'methods', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11404845,2001,,,,

Due to the very simple extraction and clean-up procedure, free pantothenic acid could be analysed within 2 h, which is much faster than by microbiological or gas chromatographic assays. For quantification of total pantothenic acid, the vitamin was liberated from its conjugates by an overnight incubation with pigeon liver pantetheinase and alkaline phosphatase. In analyses of corn flour, the intra-assay coefficient of variation was 8.5% (n = 5) and 15.3% (n = 4) for free and total pantothenic acid, respectively.

The resveratrol and piceid contents of 110 beers were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after a solid-phase extraction (SPE) using optimized and validated procedures for the beer matrix. The beer matrix effect was also studied. Stilbenes were found in quantifiable amounts in 92 beers, while concentrations below the limit of quantification (LOQ) were found in 18 beers. Resveratrol was found in the range of 1.34-77.0__g/L in 79% of the beers analyzed, and piceid was found in the range of 1.80-27.3__g/L in only 33% of them. The mean of total resveratrol in all the beers was 14.7_±20.5__g/L. The content of resveratrol has been compared with other resveratrol containing foods.

The chemical complexity associated with PACs has triggered the development of various chromatographic techniques, with countercurrent separation (CCS) gaining in popularity. This study applied the recently developed DESIGNER (Depletion and Enrichment of Select Ingredients Generating Normalized Extract Resources) approach for the selective enrichment of trimeric and tetrameric PACs using centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC). This CPC method aims at developing PAC based biomaterials, particularly for their application in restoring and repairing dental hard tissue. A general separation scheme beginning with the depletion of polymeric PACs, followed by the removal of monomeric flavan-3-ols and a final enrichment step produced PAC trimer and tetramer enriched fractions. A successful application of this separation scheme is demonstrated for four polyphenol rich plant sources: grape seeds, pine bark, cinnamon bark, and cocoa seeds. Minor modifications to the generic DESIGNER CCS method were sufficient to accommodate the varying chemical complexities of the individual source materials. The step-wise enrichment of PAC trimers and tetramers was monitored using normal phase TLC and Diol-HPLC-UV analyses. CPC proved to be a reliable tool for the selective enrichment of medium size oligomeric PACs (OPACs). This method plays a key role in the development of dental biomaterials considering its reliability and reproducibility, as well as its scale-up capabilities for possible larger-scale manufacturing.",Journal of chromatography.

0.74,18804601,"In this paper is proposed a simultaneous pre-concentration procedure using cloud point extraction for the determination of copper and zinc in food samples employing sequential multi-element flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FS-FAAS). The reagent used is 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol (PAN) and the micellar phase is obtained using the non-ionic surfactant octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (Triton X-114) and centrifugation. The optimization step was performed using Box-Behnken design for three factors: solution pH, reagent concentration and buffer concentration. A multiple response function was established in order to get an experimental condition for simultaneous extraction of copper and zinc. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the method allows the determination of copper with a limit of detection (3sigma(b)/S, LOD) of 0.1 microg L(-1), precision expressed as relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of 2.1 and 1.3% (N=10), for copper concentrations of 10 and 50 microg L(-1), respectively. Zinc is determined with a LOD of 0.15 microg L(-1) and precision as R.S.D. of 2.7 and 1.7% for concentrations of 10 and 50 microg L(-1), respectively. The enhancement factors obtained were 36 and 32 for copper and zinc, respectively. The accuracy was assessed by analysis of certified reference materials, namely, SRM 1567a - Wheat Flour and SRM 8433 - Corn Bran from National Institute of Standards & Technology and BCR 189-wholemeal flour from Institute of Reference Materials and Measurements.

A database consisting of the triacylglycerol profile of 74 genuine cocoa butter and 75 cocoa butter equivalent samples obtained by high-resolution capillary gas liquid chromatography was created, using a certified cocoa butter reference material (IRMM-801) for calibration purposes. Based on these data, a large number of cocoa butter/cocoa butter equivalent mixtures were arithmetically simulated. By subjecting the data set to various statistical tools, reliable models for both detection (univariate regression model) and quantification (multivariate model) were elaborated. Validation data sets consisting of a large number of samples (n = 4050 for detection, n = 1050 for quantification) were used to test the models. Excluding pure illip© fat samples from the data set, the detection limit was determined between 1 and 3% foreign fat in cocoa butter.

The current study for the first time is devote to the application of partial least square (PLS-1), partial robust M-regression (PRM) and feed forward neural networks (FFNNs) as linear and nonlinear chemometric methods for the simultaneous detection of binary and ternary mixtures of VA, VAI and SIA using data extracted directly from UV-spectra with overlapped peaks of individual analytes. Under the optimum experimental conditions, for each compound a linear calibration was obtained in the concentration range of 0.61-20.99 [LOD=0.12], 0.67-23.19 [LOD=0.13] and 0.73-25.12 [LOD=0.15] __gmL(-1) for VA, VAI and SIA, respectively. Four calibration sets of standard samples were designed by combination of a full and fractional factorial designs with the use of the seven and three levels for each factor for binary and ternary mixtures, respectively. The results of this study reveal that both the methods of PLS-1 and PRM are similar in terms of predict ability each binary mixtures. The resolution of ternary mixture has been accomplished by FFNNs. Multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) was applied for the description of spectra from the acid-base titration systems each individual compound, i.e. the resolution of the complex overlapping spectra as well as to interpret the extracted spectral and concentration profiles of any pure chemical species identified.

The AA and HMF contents were determined with RP-HPLC coupled to a diode array detector (DAD). AA and HMF were not stable in many processed plant products with a long shelf-life. The highest AA reduction and the largest increase in HMF content were observed in the samples stored at a higher temperature (25 _C) for 12 months. It was found that an initial water activity of 0.4 is favourable to HMF formation and that AA reduction may be considerably greater in stored products with a low initial water activity. The kind of product and its composition may also have a significant impact on acrylamide content in stored food. In the final period of storage at 25 _C, acrylamide content in 100% cocoa powder, instant baby foods, 20% cocoa powder and instant coffee was 51, 39, 35 and 33% lower than in products before storage, respectively.

The effects of these parameters on plasma robustness and on signal to background ratio (SBR) were considered in parallel, allowing the evaluation of robustness and detectability using few and fast experiments to select the best conditions for the determination of the analytes. In this case, the proposed experiments were applied to the optimization of a method aimed at the determination of Al, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, V, and Zn in chocolate drink powder. The compromise conditions that allowed obtaining a robust and sensitive analytical method were radio frequency power of 1200 W, nebulization flow rate of 0.6 L/min, and auxiliary argon flow rate of 0.3 L/min. Using these conditions, recoveries between 95 and 105% and relative standard deviations lower than 5% were obtained for the majority of the analytes.

The study examined chocolate samples from different brands and countries with different concentrations of cocoa solids from each brand. The samples were digested and filtered to remove lipids and indium was used as an internal standard to correct matrix effects. A linear correlation was found between the level of several trace elements in chocolate and the cocoa solids content. Significant levels of Bi and As were found in the cocoa bean shells but not in the cocoa bean and chocolate. This may be attributed to environmental contamination. The presence of other elements was attributed to the manufacturing processes of cocoa and chocolate products. Children, who are big consumers of chocolates, may be at risk of exceeding the daily limit of lead; whereas one 10 g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as 20% of the daily lead oral limit.

0.69,14760852,"Multidimensional analysis of denatured milk proteins is reported using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with dynamic surface tension detection (DSTD). A hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) column (a TSK-Gel Phenyl-5PW column, TosoBiosep), in the presence of 3.0 M guanidine hydrochloride (GdmHCl) as denaturing agent is employed as the mobile phase. Dynamic surface tension is measured through the differential pressure across the liquid-air interface of repeatedly growing and detaching drops. Continuous surface tension measurement throughout the entire drop growth (50 ms to 4 s) is achieved, for each eluting drop of 4 s length, providing insight into both the kinetic and thermodynamic behavior of molecular orientation processes at the liquid-air interface. An automated calibration procedure and data analysis method is applied with the DSTD system, which allows two unique solvents to be used, the HIC mobile phase for the sample and a second solvent (water for example) for the standard, permitting real-time dynamic surface tension data to be obtained. Three-dimensional data is obtained, with surface tension as a function of drop time first converted to surface pressure, which is plotted as a function of the chromatographic elution time axis. Experiments were initially performed using flow injection analysis (FIA) with the DSTD system for investigating commercial single standard milk proteins (alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-, beta-, kappa-casein and a casein mixture) denatured by GdmHCl. These FIA-DSTD experiments allowed the separation and detection conditions to be optimized for the HIC-DSTD experiments. Thus, the HIC-DSTD system has been optimized and successfully applied to the selective analysis of surface-active casein fractions (alpha s1- and beta-casein) in a commercial casein mixture, raw milk samples (cow's, ewe's and goat's milk) and other diary products (yogurt, stracchino, mozzarella, parmesan cheese and chocolate cream).

0.69,16637672,"The determination of the occurrence and level of cocoa shells in cocoa products and chocolate is an important analytical issue. The recent European Union directive on cocoa and chocolate products (2000/36/EC) has not retained the former limit of a maximum amount of 5% of cocoa shells in cocoa nibs (based on fat-free dry matter), previously authorized for the elaboration of cocoa products such as cocoa mass. In the present study, we report a reliable gas-liquid chromatography procedure suitable for the determination of the occurrence of cocoa shells in cocoa products by detection of fatty acid tryptamides (FATs). The precision of the method was evaluated by analyzing nine different samples (cocoa liquors with different ranges of shells) six times (replicate repeatability). The variations of the robust coefficient of variation of the repeatability demonstrated that FAT(C22), FAT(C24), and total FATs are good markers for the detection of shells in cocoa products. The trueness of the method was evaluated by determining the FAT content in two spiked matrices (cocoa liquors and cocoa shells) at different levels (from 1 to 50 mg/100 g). A good relation was found between the results obtained and the spiking (recovery varied between 90 and 130%), and the linearity range was established between 1 and 50 mg/100 g in cocoa products. For total FAT contents of cocoa liquor containing 5% shells, the measurement uncertainty allows us to conclude that FAT is equal to 4.01 +/- 0.8 mg/100 g. This validated method is perfectly suitable to determine shell contents in cocoa products using FAT(C22), FAT(C24), and total FATs as markers.

Because certain tobacco flavorings contain alkenylbenzenes and other toxic or carcinogenic chemicals, we measured the concentration of flavor-related compounds in bidi tobacco using a previously developed method. Twenty-three brands of bidis were sampled using automated headspace solid-phase microextraction and subsequently analyzed for 12 compounds by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Two alkenylbenzene compounds, trans-anethole and eugenol, were found in greater than 90% of the brands analyzed. Methyleugenol, pulegone and estragole were each detected in 30% or more of the brands, whereas safrole and elemicin were not detected in any of the brands.

The vegetable fats used in chocolate are designated as cocoa butter replacements and are called cocoa butter equivalents (CBE). The feasibility of CBE quantification in chocolate using triacylglycerol (TAG) profiles was conducted by analyzing 55 samples of CBs and 31 samples of CBEs using a liquid chromatograph equipped with an evaporative light scattering detector (HPLC-ELSD). Statistical evaluation of the data obtained has been performed, and a simulation study has been carried out to assess the viability to use this method for quantifying the amount of CBE in real mixtures and in chocolates. The TAGs POP, POS, PLS, and the ratios POP/PLS, POS/PLP (P, palmityl; O, oleyl; S, stearyl; L, linoleyl) are particularly significant to discriminate between CB and CBE. Analysis of 50 mixtures between 5 different CBEs and 10 different CBs at 2 different concentration levels is presented. The data are visualized and interpreted. A mathematical model has been developed to assess the amount of CBE in real mixtures. This predictive model has been successfully applied and validated on dark chocolates including authorized CBE. The results are affected by +/-2.1% absolute average error. In particular, estimations between 10 and 20% of CBE show a very good match. On the other hand, values equal to or smaller than 5% show a larger prediction error (detection limit of the method). For the main purpose of this method (i.e., quantification of CBE at 5% max in chocolate, which represents about 15% of the total fat) this model shows very good results. For milk chocolate, the mathematical model can also be used if TAG are integrated from partition number (PN) 46 to 54.

Our results have shown that PAC dimers and trimers with interflavan linkage variations exhibited differential absorbance response.

0.66,12526004,"Liquid chromatography coupled with ionspray mass spectrometry in the tandem mode (LC/MS/MS) with negative ion detection was used for the identification of a variety of phenolic compounds in a cocoa sample. Gradient elution with water and acetonitrile, both containing 0.1% HCOOH, was used. Standard solutions of 31 phenolic compounds, including benzoic and cinnamic acids and flavonoid compounds, were studied in the negative ion mode using MS/MS product ion scans. At low collisional activation, the deprotonated molecule [M - H](-) was observed for all the compounds studied. For cinnamic and benzoic acids, losses of CO(2) or formation of [M - CH(3)](-*) in the case of methoxylated compounds were observed. However, for flavonol and flavone glycosides, the spectra present both the deprotonated molecule [M - H](-) of the glycoside and the ion corresponding to the deprotonated aglycone [A - H](-). The latter ion is formed by loss of the rhamnose, glucose, galactose or arabinose residue from the glycosides. Different fragmentation patterns were observed in MS/MS experiments for flavone-C-glycosides which showed fragmentation in the sugar part. Fragmentation of aglycones provided characteristic ions for each family of flavonoids. The optimum LC/MS/MS conditions were applied to the characterization of a cocoa sample that had been subjected to an extraction/clean-up procedure which involved chromatography on Sephadex LH20 and thin-layer chromatographic monitoring. In addition to compounds described in the literature, such as epicatechin and catechin, quercetin, isoquercitrin (quercetin-3-O-glucoside) and quercetin-3-O-arabinose, other compounds were identified for the first time in cocoa samples, such as hyperoside (quercetin-3-O-galactoside), naringenin, luteolin, apigenin and some O-glucosides and C-glucosides of these compounds.",Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS,"['D002099', 'D002853', 'D005419', 'D010636', 'D021241']","['Cacao', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Flavonoids', 'Phenols', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",Liquid chromatographic/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric study of the phenolic composition of cocoa (Theobroma cacao).,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None]","['chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12526004,2003,,,,
0.66,11675670,"Quantitative analyses of fatty acids from five triacylglycerol products, coconut oil, palm kernel oil, palm oil, lard and cocoa butter, were carried out using two analytical methods: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) and gas chromatography (GC), in an effort to validate the application of MALDI-TOFMS in quantitative fatty acid analysis. For the GC analysis, transmethylated products were used, whereas, for the MALDI-TOF analysis, saponified products were used. Under MALDI-TOF conditions, the acids were detected as sodiated sodium carboxylates [RCOONa + Na](+) consistent with the mode of ionization that was previously reported. Thus, the MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of saponified coconut oil showed the presence of sodiated sodium salts of caprylic acid (7.5 +/- 0.67, m/z 189), capric acid (6.9 +/- 0.83, m/z 217), lauric acid (47.8 +/- 0.67, m/z 245), myristic acid (20.4 +/- 0.51, m/z 273), palmitic acid (9.8 +/- 0.47, m/z 301), linoleic acid (0.9 +/- 0.07, m/z 325), oleic acid (4.8 +/- 0.42, m/z 327) and stearic acid (2.0 +/- 0.13, m/z 329). Saponified palm kernel oil had a fatty acid profile that included caprylic acid (3.5 +/- 0.59), capric acid (4.7 +/- 0.82), lauric acid (58.6 +/- 2.3), myristic acid (20.9 +/- 1.5), palmitic acid (7.2 +/- 1.1), oleic acid (3.8 +/- 0.62) and stearic acid (1.2 +/- 0.15). Saponified palm oil gave myristic acid (0.83 +/- 0.18), palmitic acid (55.8 +/- 1.7), linoleic acid (4.2 +/- 0.51), oleic acid (34.5 +/- 1.5), stearic acid (3.8 +/- 0.26) and arachidic acid (0.80 +/- 0.22). Saponified lard showed the presence of myristic acid (1.5 +/- 0.24), palmitic acid (28.9 +/- 1.3), linoleic acid (13.7 +/- 0.67), oleic acid (38.7 +/- 1.4), stearic acid (12.8 +/- 0.64) and arachidic acid (2.4 +/- 0.35).

Quantitative gas chromatographic analysis of the corresponding methyl esters from these triacylglycerol products yielded data that were mostly in agreement with the MALDI-TOFMS data.

Accuracy of analyses was ascertained by comparing analyses on a NIST standard reference chocolate with NIST certified values. Procyanidin (PC) content was related to the nonfat cocoa solid (NFCS) content. The natural cocoa powders (average 87% of NFCS) contained the highest levels of AOC (826 +/- 103 micromol of TE/g) and PCs (40.8 +/- 8.3 mg/g). Alkalized cocoa (Dutched powders, average 80% NFCS) contained lower AOC (402 +/- 6 micromol of TE /g) and PCs (8.9 +/- 2.7 mg/g). Unsweetened chocolates or chocolate liquor (50% NFCS) contained 496 +/- 40 micromol of TE /g of AOC and 22.3 +/- 2.9 mg/g of PCs. Milk chocolates, which contain the least amount of NFCS (7.1%), had the lowest concentrations of AOC (80 +/- 10 micromol of TE /g) and PCs (2.7 +/- 0.5 mg/g). One serving of cocoa (5 g) or chocolate (15 or 40 g, depending upon the type of chocolate) provides 2000-9100 micromol of TE of AOC and 45-517 mg of PCs, amounts that exceed the amount in a serving of the majority of foods consumed in America. The monomers through trimers, which are thought to be directly bioavailable, contributed 30% of the total PCs in chocolates. Hydrophilic antioxidant capacity contributed >90% of AOC in all products. The correlation coefficient between AOC and PCs in chocolates was 0.92, suggesting that PCs are the dominant antioxidants in cocoa and chocolates. These results indicate that NFCS is correlated with AOC and PC in cocoa and chocolate products.

The modulation temperature was optimized to achieve the best separation and signal enhancement. The separation pattern of trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives of flavonoids was compared on two complementary column sets. Whilst the BPX5/BPX50 (NP/P) column set offers better overall separation, BPX50/BPX5 (P/NP) provides better peak shape and sensitivity. Comparison of the identification power of GC_GC-TOFMS against both the NIST05 MS library and a laboratory (created in-house) TOFMS library was carried out on a flavonoid mixture. The basic retention index information on high-performance capillary columns with a non-polar stationary phase was established and database of mass spectra of trimethylsilyl derivatives of flavonoids was compiled. TOFMS coupled to GC_GC enabled satisfactory identification of flavonoids in complex matrix samples at their LOD over a range of 0.5-10 __g/mL.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the lipid profile of different types of Brazilian chocolate through characterization by FT-Raman spectroscopy and identification and quantification of major fatty acids (FAs) by CZE to confirm FT-Raman spectrometry results. It was found that the main spectroscopic profile difference of the chocolate samples analyzed was related to the presence of saturated or unsaturated FAs. Well defined bands at approximately 1660, 1267, and 1274 cm(-1) corresponding to vibrational modes of unsaturated FAs (UnFAs) were found only in the spectra of samples with cocoa butter in their composition according to label specifications, mainly in dark chocolate samples. The FA identification and quantification by CZE found the presence of stearic (18:0) and palmitic (16:0) acids as the major saturated FAs in all chocolate samples. Dark chocolate samples showed the highest levels of oleic (cis-9 18:1) and linoleic (cis, cis -9,12 18:2) UnFAs monitored and the lowest levels of 14:0 in their chemical composition. Samples coded as 02 (with not only cocoa butter in their composition according to label) had the highest levels of 14:0 (FA not present in cocoa butter composition) corresponding to label information and inferring the presence of other fat sources, called cocoa butter substitutes, mainly for milk and white chocolate samples. This study suggests FT-Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique that can be used to chemically characterize the chocolate lipid fraction, and CZE is a tool able to confirm Raman spectroscopy results and identify and quantify the major FAs in chocolate samples.

Cocoa samples were fermented using a technique mimicking recommended on-farm practices. The sensory cocoa quality was assessed by experienced tasters, and seven major chemical taste compounds were quantified by near infrared spectrometry (NIRS). The association of the nine, partially admixed, genotype spectra with the analytical and sensory quality parameters was tested. The individual parameters were analyzed as a function of the factors GG and harvest (including the date of fermentation), individual trees within a single GG were used as replications. In fermented cocoa, significant GG-specific differences were observed for methylxanthines, theobromine-to-caffeine (T/C) ratio, total fat, procyanidin B5 and epicatechin, as well as the sensory attributes global score, astringency, and dry fruit aroma, but differences related to harvest were also apparent. The potential cocoa yield was also highly determined by the individual GG, although there was significant tree-to-tree variation within every single GG. Non-fermented samples showed large harvest-to-harvest variation of their chemical composition, while differences between GG were insignificant. These results suggest that selection by the genetic background, represented here by groups of partially admixed genotype spectra, would be a useful strategy toward enhancing quality and yield of cocoa in Nicaragua. Selection by the GG within the local, genetically segregating populations of seed-propagated cacao, followed by clonal propagation of best-performing individuals of the selected GG could be a viable alternative to traditional propagation of cacao by seed from open pollination.

An efficient method to extract root proteins for 2-DE was established to overcome these problems. The main features of this protocol are: i) precipitation with trichloroacetic acid/acetone overnight to prepare the acetone dry powder (ADP), ii) several additional steps of sonication in the ADP preparation and extractions with dense sodium dodecyl sulfate and phenol, and iii) adding two stages of phenol extractions. Proteins were extracted from roots using this new protocol (Method B) and a protocol described in the literature for T. cacao leaves and meristems (Method A).

In both types of samples, OTA was extracted with methanol-3% sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and then purified using immunoaffinity columns prior to HPLC analysis. Due to the fact that different recovery values were obtained for OTA from both types of samples, a revalidation of the method in the case of cocoa nibs was needed. Revalidation was based on the following criteria: Selectivity, limits of detection and quantification (0.03 and 0.1 microg kg(-1), respectively), precision (within-day and between-day variability) and recovery 84.2% (RSD = 7.1%), and uncertainty (30%). Fourteen of the twenty-two cocoa bean samples (64%) suffered a loss of OTA of more than 95% due to shelling, six samples suffered a loss of OTA in the range 65-95%, and only one sample presented a reduction of less than 50%.

The organic (chloroform) layer was separated. (B) Samples (such as ice cream) containing substantial water were mixed with anhydrous Na2SO4 and stirred to sandy appearance and dried. The residue was homogenized with ether, followed by centrifuging, and the organic (ether) layer was separated. (C) Dried samples (such as chocolate and cookie) were smashed, homogenized with ether, and followed by centrifuging, and the organic (ether) layer was separated. (D) Candy was dissolved in warm water and the solution was extracted with ether. The organic (ether) layer was separated. Each organic layer from (A)-(D) was washed with 10% NaHCO3 and evaporated. The residue containing TAc was dissolved in dichloromethane. The extract obtained was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel.

Instead of containing mineral and vegetable oils, the low-migration printing inks are based on a novel fatty acid ester. The migration of this alternative solvent was investigated according to DIN EN 14338 in Tenax simulant and in different types of food. For specific detection of the fatty acid ester, LC-MS/MS (APCI) was chosen due to its higher sensitivity and selectivity than GC/MS. Printed packaging materials from three different commercially available food products (meat, chocolate and sweets) were tested. Migration of the fatty acid ester from the packaging into simulants was analysed. For food samples, a clean-up method based on solid-phase extraction was developed and migration of the fatty acid ester into meat, chocolate and sweets was also demonstrated.

The DP of the procyanidins was determined by thiolysis. Quantification was done by using purified oligomeric and polymeric cocoa procyanidins as external standards. Sorghum procyanidins were composed mostly of high MW (DP > 10) polymers. Significant differences were observed in levels as well as distribution of the different MW procyanidins between the sorghums. Processing of the sorghum brans into cookies and bread significantly reduced the levels of procyanidins; this effect was more pronounced in the higher MW polymers. Cookies had a higher retention of procyanidins (42-84%) than bread (13-69%). Extrusion of sorghum grain resulted in an increase in the levels of procyanidin oligomers with DP </= 4 and decrease in polymers with DP >/= 6.

0.62,26138682,"With the revision of the European Tobacco Products Directive (2014/40/EU), characterizing flavors such as strawberry, candy, vanillin or chocolate will be prohibited in cigarettes and fine-cut tobacco. Product surveillance will therefore require analytical means to define and subsequently detect selected characterizing flavors that are formed by supplemented flavors within the complex matrix tobacco. We have analyzed strawberry-flavored tobacco products as an example for characterizing fruit-like aroma. Using this approach, we looked into aroma components to find indicative patterns or features that can be used to satisfy obligatory product information as requested by the European Directive. Accordingly, a headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technique was developed and coupled to subsequent gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to characterize different strawberry-flavored tobacco products (cigarettes, fine-cut tobacco, liquids for electronic cigarettes, snus, shisha tobacco) for their volatile additives. The results were compared with non-flavored, blend characteristic flavored and other fruity-flavored cigarettes, as well as fresh and dried strawberries. Besides different esters and aldehydes, the terpenes linalool, _±-terpineol, nerolidol and limonene as well as the lactones __-decalactone, __-dodecalactone and __-undecalactone could be verified as compounds sufficient to convey some sort of strawberry flavor to tobacco. Selected flavors, i.e., limonene, linalool, _±-terpineol, citronellol, carvone and __-decalactone, were analyzed further with respect to their stereoisomeric composition by using enantioselective HS-SPME-GC/MS. These experiments confirmed that individual enantiomers that differ in taste or physiological properties can be distinguished within the tobacco matrix. By comparing the enantiomeric composition of these compounds in the tobacco with that of fresh and dried strawberries, it can be concluded that non-natural strawberry aroma is usually used to produce strawberry-flavored tobacco products. Such authenticity control can become of interest particularly when manufacturers claim that natural sources were used for flavoring of products. Although the definition of characterizing flavors by analytical means remains challenging, specific compounds or features are required to be defined for routine screening of reported information. Clarifications by sensory testing might still be necessary, but could be limited to a few preselected samples.

Since MDA is considered a presumptive biomarker for lipid peroxidation in live organisms, a model for nutritionally induced oxidative stress (hypercholesterolemic rats) was studied in comparison with normocholesterolemic animals. The effect of diet supplementation with fruits rich in antioxidant polyphenols was assessed. The proposed method showed to be precise and reproducible, as well as sensitive enough to reflect differences in the oxidative status in vivo. A significant decrease of serum and liver MDA concentrations in animals fed diets containing 0.3% of polyphenols from strawberry, cocoa or plum was observed in the normocholesterolemic groups. This reduction was especially noteworthy in the hypercholesterolemic animals, with increased MDA levels indicating enhanced lipid peroxidation in the controls, yet with values parallel to the normocholesterolemic groups in animals fed the polyphenol-rich diets.

0.61,20543060,"Pectinolytic enzymes play an important role in cocoa fermentation. In this study, we characterized three extracellular pectate lyases (Pels) produced by bacilli isolated from fermenting cocoa beans. These enzymes, named Pel-22, Pel-66, and Pel-90, were synthesized by Bacillus pumilus BS22, Bacillus subtilis BS66, and Bacillus fusiformis BS90, respectively. The three Pels were produced under their natural conditions and purified from the supernatants using a one-step chromatography method. The purified enzymes exhibited optimum activity at 60 degrees C, and the half-time of thermoinactivation at this temperature was approximately 30 min. Pel-22 had a low specific activity compared with the other two enzymes. However, it displayed high affinity for the substrate, about 2.5-fold higher than those of Pel-66 and Pel-90. The optimum pHs were 7.5 for Pel-22 and 8.0 for Pel-66 and Pel-90. The three enzymes trans-eliminated polygalacturonate in a random manner to generate two long oligogalacturonides, as well as trimers and dimers. A synergistic effect was observed between Pel-22 and Pel-66 and between Pel-22 and Pel-90, but not between Pel-90 and Pel-66. The Pels were also strongly active on highly methylated pectins (up to 60% for Pel-66 and Pel-90 and up to 75% for Pel-22). Fe(2+) was found to be a better cofactor than Ca(2+) for Pel-22 activity, while Ca(2+) was the best cofactor for Pel-66 and Pel-90. The amino acid sequences deduced from the cloned genes showed the characteristics of Pels belonging to Family 1. The pel-66 and pel-90 genes appear to be very similar, but they are different from the pel-22 gene.

The extraction method is rapid (as compared with existing methods), simple, reliable and practical to perform without complex experimental set-ups. The cocoa samples were freshly extracted and cleaned-up using immunoaffinity column (IAC) for HPLC analysis using a fluorescence detector. Under the optimised condition, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for OTA were 0.62 and 1.25 ng ml(-1) respectively in standard solutions. The method could successfully quantify OTA in naturally contaminated samples. Moreover, good recoveries of OTA were obtained up to 86.5% in artificially spiked cocoa samples, with a maximum relative standard deviation (RSD) of 2.7%. The proposed extraction method could determine OTA at the level 1.5 _µg kg(-)(1), which surpassed the standards set by the European Union for cocoa (2 _µg kg(-1)).

It has been previously demonstrated that the toxin is concentrated in cocoa shells. The aim of this study was to assay a simple chemical method for ochratoxin A reduction from naturally contaminated cocoa shells. In order to determine the efficiency of the method, a high-performance liquid chromatography method with fluorescence detection was set up beforehand and validated. Ochratoxin A was extracted from cocoa shells with methanol-3% sodium bicarbonate solution and then purified with immunoaffinity columns. The recovery attained was 88.7% (relative standard deviation = 6.36%) and the limits of detection and quantification were 0.06 and 0.2 kg/kg, respectively. For decontamination experiments, the solvent extractor ASE 200 was used. First, aqueous solutions of 2% sodium bicarbonate and potassium carbonate were compared under the same conditions (1,500 lb/in2 at 40 degrees C for 10 min). Higher ochratoxin A reduction was obtained with potassium carbonate (83 versus 27%). Then, this salt was used under different conditions of pressure, temperature, and time. The greatest ochratoxin A reduction was achieved with an aqueous potassium carbonate solution (2%), at 1,000 lb/in2 at 90 degrees C for 10 min.

Many flavored bidis contain high concentrations of compounds such as eugenol, anethole, methyleugenol, pulegone, and estragole; several of these compounds have known toxic or carcinogenic properties. Clove cigarettes, or kreteks, are another highly flavored tobacco product with high levels of eugenol due to clove buds present in the tobacco filler. In this study, compounds in the burnable portion-the filler and wrapper material actually consumed during the smoking of bidis, kreteks, and U.S. cigarettes-were analyzed. Flavor-related compounds were solvent extracted from the burnable portion of each cigarette with methanol. An aliquot of the methanol extract was heated, and the sample headspace was sampled with a solid-phase microextraction fiber and introduced into a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer for analysis in selected-ion monitoring mode. High levels of eugenol were detected in five clove-flavored bidi brands ranging from 78.6 to 7130 microg/cigarette (microg/cig), whereas diphenyl ether (128-3550 microg/cig) and methyl anthranilate (154-2360 microg/cig) were found in one grape-flavored bidi brand.

In fats and oils, determining the presence of one or two regioisomers and the identification of structure, where they do have one, as well as their separation, became a problem of fundamental importance to solve. A variety of instrumental technics has been proposed, such as MS, chromatography-MS or pure chromatography. A number of studies deal with the optimization of the separation, but very often, they are expensive in time. In the present study, in order to decrease the analysis time while maintaining good chromatographic separation, we tested different monomeric and polymeric stationary phases and different chromatographic conditions (mobile phase composition and analysis temperature) using Non-Aqueous Reversed Phase Liquid Chromatography (NARP-LC). It was demonstrated that mixed polymeric stationary bonded silica with accessible terminal hydroxyl groups leads to very good separation for the pairs of TAGs regioisomers constituted by two saturated and one unsaturated fatty acid (with double bond number: from 1 to 6). A Nucleodur C18 ISIS percolated by isocratic mobile phase (acetonitrile/2-propanol) at 18_C leads to their separations in less than 15min.

Using the recently developed half-tongue test, human recognition thresholds for the astringent and mouth-drying oral sensation were determined to be between 26 and 220 micromol/L (water) depending on the amino acid moiety.

However, the content of GCG in traditional green tea is too low which limits its in-depth pharmacological research and application. In the present study, a simple, efficient and environment-friendly chromatographic separation method was developed for preparative enrichment and separation of GCG from cocoa tea (Camellia ptilophylla) which contains high content of GCG. In the first step, the adsorption properties of selected resins were evaluated, and XAD-7HP resin was chosen by its adsorption and desorption properties for GCG. In order to maximize column efficiency for GCG collection, the operating parameters (e.g., flow rate, ethanol concentration, and bed height) were optimized. We found that the best combination was the feed concentration at 20mg/mL, flow rate at 0.75 BV/h and the ratio of diameter to bed heights as 1:12. Under these conditions, the purity of GCG was 45% with a recovery of 89%. In order to obtain pure target, a second step was established using column chromatography with sephadex LH-20 gel and 55% ethanol-water solution as eluent.

0.56,26637047,"Direct analysis of microbial cocultures grown on agar media by desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) is quite challenging. Due to the high gas pressure upon impact with the surface, the desorption mechanism does not allow direct imaging of soft or irregular surfaces. The divots in the agar, created by the high-pressure gas and spray, dramatically change the geometry of the system decreasing the intensity of the signal. In order to overcome this limitation, an imprinting step, in which the chemicals are initially transferred to flat hard surfaces, was coupled to DESI-MS and applied for the first time to fungal cocultures. Note that fungal cocultures are often disadvantageous in direct imaging mass spectrometry. Agar plates of fungi present a complex topography due to the simultaneous presence of dynamic mycelia and spores. One of the most devastating diseases of cocoa trees is caused by fungal phytopathogen Moniliophthora roreri. Strategies for pest management include the application of endophytic fungi, such as Trichoderma harzianum, that act as biocontrol agents by antagonizing M. roreri. However, the complex chemical communication underlying the basis for this phytopathogen-dependent biocontrol is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the metabolic exchange that takes place during the antagonistic interaction between M. roreri and T. harzianum. Using imprint-DESI-MS imaging we annotated the secondary metabolites released when T. harzianum and M. roreri were cultured in isolation and compared these to those produced after 3 weeks of coculture. We identified and localized four phytopathogen-dependent secondary metabolites, including T39 butenolide, harzianolide, and sorbicillinol. In order to verify the reliability of the imprint-DESI-MS imaging data and evaluate the capability of tape imprints to extract fungal metabolites while maintaining their localization, six representative plugs along the entire M. roreri/T. harzianum coculture plate were removed, weighed, extracted, and analyzed by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Our results not only provide a better understanding of M. roreri-dependent metabolic induction in T. harzianum, but may seed novel directions for the advancement of phytopathogen-dependent biocontrol, including the generation of optimized Trichoderma strains against M. roreri, new biopesticides, and biofertilizers.

It may also be present if the cartonboard is made from recycled fibres recovered from printed materials. A method has been devised to test for benzophenone in cartonboard packaging materials and to test for migration levels in foodstuffs. Packaging is extracted with solvent containing d10-benzophenone as the internal standard. Foods are extracted with solvent containing d10-benzophenone and the extract defatted using hexane. The extracts are analysed by GC-MS. For analysis of food, the limit of detection was 0.01 mg x kg(-1) and the limit of quantification was 0.05 mg x kg(-1). The calibration was linear from 0.05 to 20 mg x kg(-1). The method for food analysis was validated in-house and it also returned satisfactory results in a blind check-sample exercise organized by an independent laboratory. The methods were applied to the analysis of 350 retail samples that used printed cartonboard packaging. A total of 207 (59%) packaging samples had no significant benzophenone (<0.05 mg x dm(-2)). Seven (2%) were in the range 0.05- 0.2 mg x dm(-2), 60 (17%) were from 0.2 to 0.8 mg x dm(-2) and 76 (22%) were from 0.8 to 3.3 mg x dm(-2). A total of 71 samples were then selected at random from the 143 packaging samples that contained benzophenone, and the food itself was analysed. Benzophenone was detected in 51 (72%) of the foods. Two food samples (3%) were in the range 0.01-0.05 mg kg(-1). A total of 29 (41%) were from 0.05 to 0.5 mg kg(-1), 17 (24%) were from 0.5 to 5 mg x kg(-1) and three (4%) food samples exceeded 5 mg x kg(-1). The highest level of benzophenone in food was 7.3 mg x kg(-1) for a high-fat chocolate confectionery product packaged in direct contact with cartonboard, with room temperature storage conditions and with a high contact area:food mass ratio. When the mass fraction of benzophenone migration was calculated for the different contact and storage regimes involved, the attenuation effects of indirect contact and of low temperature storage were cumulative. Thus, there was a sixfold reduction in migration for indirect contact compared with direct contact, a sixfold reduction for chilled/frozen storage compared with ambient storage, and 40-fold reduction for the two contact conditions combined.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D001577', 'D005506', 'D018857', 'D005519', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D007281', 'D011786', 'D013696']","['Benzophenones', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Packaging', 'Food Preservation', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Ink', 'Quality Control', 'Temperature']",Benzophenone in cartonboard packaging materials and the factors that influence its migration into food.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', None, None, None, None]","['analysis', 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'methods', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12881135,2003,,,,

In the study, each flavanol compound, as a solution in water or a dairy product or as a chocolate dispersion in water, was administered intragastrically to male Sprague-Dawley rats in an amount equal to or equivalent to 350 mg/kg. In each instance, blood samples were collected over a 5 h period, and used to measure plasma total catechin concentrations by HPLC after enzymatic hydrolysis of flavanol conjugates. Pharmacokinetic data were evaluated using a one compartment approach. Whole milk and heavy cream, and to a much lesser extent skim milk, lowered the oral absorption of both (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin and altered the AUC, C(max), k(a), k(e) and t1/2 values in direct proportion to their fat, but not to their protein, content. In addition, the t(max) for solutions of (-)-epicatechin in water and skim milk occurred 2 h earlier than from solutions in whole milk and heavy cream. Similarly, dispersions of baking chocolate in water and in whole milk yielded plasma levels of monomeric catechins that were, respectively, about equal to and much lower than those from aqueous solutions of authentic flavanols. A determining role for a chocolate matrix (dark, dairy milk or white chocolate) on the oral absorption of its constitutive monomeric flavanols was suggested by the apparent variability in plasma total catechins levels that existed among them both before and after their spiking with equal amounts of exogenous (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin. Such a variability could reflect differences among different chocolates in terms of their physical properties, matrix components, and matrix characteristics imposed by the manufacturing process used for each type of chocolate.

Standard practice is cross-validation (CV), where a set of chemical and associated sensory data is partitioned so chemometric models can be developed on training subsets, and validated on held-out subsets. CV demonstrates prediction, but is an unlikely scenario for industrial operations, where concomitant data acquisition for model development and test materials would be unwieldy. We evaluated cocoa materials of diverse provenance, and analyzed on different dates to those used in model development. Liquor extracts were analyzed by flow-injection electrospray-mass spectrometry (FIE-MS), a novel method for sensory quality prediction. FIE-MS enabled prediction of sensory qualities described by trained human panelists. Optimal models came from the Weka data-mining algorithm SimpleLinearRegression, which learns a model for the attribute giving minimal training error, which was (-)-epicatechin. This flavonoid likewise dominated partial least-squares (PLS)-regression models. Refinements of PLS (orthogonal-PLS or orthogonal signal correction) gave poorer generalization to different test sets, as did support vector machines, whose hyperparameters could not be optimized in training to avoid overfitting.

The sterol balance technique was used to compare the changes in serum cholesterol concentration with the excretion of fecal steroids. The method used for the analysis of fecal steroids was chemical, with a final identification and quantification by gas-liquid chromatography. It was confirmed that the chemical method for fecal steroid analysis was accurate and reproducible. The three dietary periods were each 3 wk in length. In sequence, cocoa butter (period I), corn oil, and cocoa butter (period III) were fed at 40% of the total calories. All diets were cholesterol free, contained similar amounts of plant sterols, and were identical in other nutrients. Corn oil had a hypocholesterolemic effect. Mean serum cholesterol concentrations were 222 mg/100 ml (cocoa butter, period I), 177 during corn oil, and 225 after the return to cocoa butter. Individual fecal steroids were determined from stools pooled for 7 days. Both neutral steroids and bile acids were altered significantly by dietary polyunsaturated fat. The change in bile acid excretion was considerably greater than the change in neutral steroids. Corn oil caused a greater fecal excretion of both deoxycholic and lithocholic acids. The total mean excretion (milligrams per day) of fecal steroids was 709 for cocoa butter (period I), 915 for corn oil, and 629 for the second cocoa butter period. The enhanced total fecal steroid excretion by the polyunsaturated fat of corn oil created a negative cholesterol balance vis-_-vis the saturated fat of cocoa butter. The hypocholesterolemic effect of polyunsaturated fat was associated with total fecal sterol excretion twice greater than the amount of cholesterol calculated to leave the plasma.

Because of the reported poor stability of catechins in alkaline solutions, acidic conditions (pH 2.5) were chosen and consequently the electroosmotic flow (EOF) was significantly suppressed; this resulted in a fast anodic migration of the analytes partitioned into the SDS micelles. Under these conditions, variations of either pH value in acidic range or SDS concentration, showed to be not suitable to modulate the selectivity. To overcome this limit, use of additives to the SDS-based running buffer was successfully applied and three different systems were optimized for the separation of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, caffeine, and theobromine in chocolate and cocoa powder samples. In particular, two mixed micelle systems were applied; the first consisted of a mixture of SDS and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propansulfonate (CHAPS) with a composition of 90 mM and 10 mM, respectively; the second was SDS and taurodeoxycholic acid sodium salt (TDC) with a composition of 70 mM and 30 mM, respectively.

Slowed starch digestion can theoretically increase satiety by modulating glucose ""spiking"" and depletion that occurs after carbohydrate-rich meals. Tannins were isolated from extracts of pomegranate, cranberry, grape, and cocoa and these isolates tested for effectiveness to inhibit the activity of _±-amylase and glucoamylase in vitro. The compositions of the isolates were confirmed by NMR and LC/MS analysis, and tannin-protein interactions were investigated using relevant enzyme assays and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results demonstrated inhibition of each enzyme by each tannin, but with variation in magnitude.

However, their exploitation for authenticity, a requirement in these commodities that have a large origin-based price-range, by the standard method of isotope ratio monitoring by mass spectrometry (irm-MS) is limited. We have now developed a methodology that overcomes this deficit that exploits the power of isotopic quantitative (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry combined with chemical modification of the xanthines to enable the determination of positional intramolecular (13)C/(12)C ratios (__(13)Ci) with high precision. However, only caffeine is amenable to analysis: theobromine and theophylline present substantial difficulties due to their poor solubility. However, their N-methylation to caffeine makes spectral acquisition feasible. The method is confirmed as robust, with good repeatability of the __(13)Ci values in caffeine appropriate for isotope fractionation measurements at natural abundance. It is shown that there is negligible isotope fractionation during the chemical N-methylation procedure. Thus, the method preserves the original positional __(13)Ci values. The method has been applied to measure the position-specific variation of the (13)C/(12)C distribution in caffeine.

It is assumed that higher cocoa solids contents are indicative of higher polyphenol concentrations, which have potential health benefits. However, cocoa solids include polyphenol-free cocoa butter and polyphenol-rich nonfat cocoa solids (NFCS). In this study the strength of the relationship between NFCS content (estimated by theobromine as a proxy) and polyphenol content was tested in chocolate samples with labeled cocoa solids contents in the range of 20-100%, grouped as dark (n = 46), milk (n = 8), and those chocolates containing inclusions such as wafers or nuts (n = 15). The relationship was calculated with regard to both total polyphenol content and individual polyphenols. In dark chocolates, NFCS is linearly related to total polyphenols (r2 = 0.73). Total polyphenol content appears to be systematically slightly higher for milk chocolates than estimated by the dark chocolate model, whereas for chocolates containing other ingredients, the estimates fall close to or slightly below the model results. This shows that extra components such as milk, wafers, or nuts might influence the measurements of both theobromine and polyphenol contents. For each of the six main polyphenols (as well as their sum), the relationship with the estimated NFCS was much lower than for total polyphenols (r2 < 0.40), but these relationships were independent of the nature of the chocolate type, indicating that they might still have some predictive capabilities.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002099', 'D002392', 'D002845', 'D005419', 'D010636', 'D059808', 'D013805']","['Cacao', 'Catechin', 'Chromatography', 'Flavonoids', 'Phenols', 'Polyphenols', 'Theobromine']",Predictive relationship between polyphenol and nonfat cocoa solids content of chocolate.,"['Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","['chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18052039,2008,0,0,,chocolate analysis

In the present study, the combination of fractionation, chemical derivatization and various mass spectrometric approaches is described to determine the exact position of sulphate group in methylated epicatechin metabolites. Four O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-O-sulphate metabolites isolated from human urine samples were derivatized under mild condition using trimethylsilyldiazomethane (TMSD) in the presence of methanol. The resulting methylated reaction products were then analyzed by high resolution and multistage mass spectrometry for the subsequent identification of the sulphate positional isomers. Results show that O-methylation affects the charge delocalization in negatively charged ions and hereby the fragmentation pattern of the sulphate isomers allowing the identification of diagnostic ions. In addition, this study demonstrates that methoxy derivatives of polyphenol metabolites can be prepared using TMSD. Subsequently, the localization of the sulphate group in the polyphenol metabolites can be achieved by analyzing the methoxy derivatives by multistage mass spectrometry. Using an enzymatic reaction for identification of the O-methyl position, and a chemical O-methylation with TMSD follow by high resolution and multistage tandem MS for the identification of the sulphate group position, we were able to identify the previously unknown O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-O-sulphate.

Previously we found that cocoa tea demonstrated a beneficial effect against high-fat diet induced obesity, hepatic steatosis, and hyperlipidemia in mice. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-adipogenic effect of cocoa tea in vitro using preadipocytes 3T3-L1. Adipogenic differentiation was confirmed by Oil Red O stain, qPCR and Western blot. Our results demonstrated that cocoa tea significantly inhibited triglyceride accumulation in mature adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Cocoa tea was shown to suppress the expressions of key adipogenic transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR __) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP _±). The tea extract was subsequently found to reduce the expressions of adipocyte-specific genes such as sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FAS), Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid translocase (FAT) and stearoylcoenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD-1). In addition, JNK, ERK and p38 phosphorylation were inhibited during cocoa tea inhibition of 3T3-L1 adipogenic differentiation.

Procyanidin oligomers, monomers through undecamers, were identified in Ross clingstone peaches. Optimized methods allowed for the quantitation of oligomers through octamers. The profile of procyanidins in peaches is similar to profiles found in grapes, chocolate, and beverages linked to health benefits such as tea and wine. The monomer content in frozen peeled peaches was found to be 19.59 mg/kg. Dimers (39.59 mg/kg) and trimers (38.81 mg/kg) constituted the largest percent composition of oligomers in the peaches. Tetramers through octamers were present in levels of 17.81, 12.43, 10.62, 3.94 and 1.75 mg/kg, respectively. Thermal processing resulted in an 11% reduction in monomers, a 9% reduction in dimers, a 12% reduction in trimers, a 6% reduction in tetramers, and a 5% reduction in pentamers. Hexamers and heptamers demonstrated an approximate 30% loss, and octamers were no longer detected. Analysis of the syrup after thermal processing indicates that there is a migration of procyanidin monomers through hexamers into the syrup that can account for the losses observed during the canning process. Storage of canned peaches for 3 months demonstrated a time-related loss in higher oligomers and that by 3 months oligomers larger than tetramers are not observed. At 3 months postcanning, levels of monomers had decreased by 10%, dimers by 16%, trimers by 45%, and tetramers by 80%.

Although its health promoting characteristics have been known for a while, a very limited amount of scientific research has been focused on Cocoa tea. Herein, a systematic study on Cocoa tea and its chemical components, interactions and bioactivities was performed. YD tea (Yunnan Daye tea, Camellia sinensis), a tea species with a high caffeine content (5.8% by dry weight), was used as a control. By UV-Vis spectrometry, High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), and Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS) for chemical composition analysis, C-2 epimeric isomers of tea catechins and theobromine were found to be the major catechins and methylxanthine in Cocoa tea, respectively. More gallated catechins, methylxanthines, and proteins were detected in Cocoa tea compared with YD tea. Moreover, the tendency of major components in Cocoa tea for precipitation was significantly higher than that in YD tea. Catechins, methylxanthines, proteins, iron, calcium, and copper were presumed to be the origins of molecular interactions in Cocoa tea and YD tea. The interactions between catechins and methylxanthines were highly related to the galloyl moiety in catechins and methyl groups in methylxanthines. In vitro anti-inflammatory activity assays revealed that Cocoa tea was a more potent inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage cells (RAW 264.7) than YD tea. This study constructs a solid phytochemical foundation for further research on the mechanisms of molecular interactions and the integrated functions of Cocoa tea.

The performance of this method was compared with that of a non-competitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method with ICP-MS detection of the metal used to tag the antibody for the quantitative peanut protein analysis in food. The limit of detection (LOD) and quantitation of the ICP-MS immunoassay were 2.2 and 5 microg peanuts g(-1) matrix, respectively, the recovery ranged from 86 +/- 18% to 110 +/- 4% and linearity was proved in the 5-50 microg g(-1) range. The LC/MS/MS method allowed us to obtain LODs of 1 and 5 microg protein g(-1) matrix for Ara h3/4 and Ara h2, respectively, thus obtaining significantly higher values with respect to the ELISA ICP-MS method, taking into account the different expression for concentrations. Linearity was established in the 10-200 microg g(-1) range of peanut proteins in the food matrix investigated and good precision (RSD <10%) was demonstrated.

A baseline separation of the catechin and epicatechin enantiomers was achieved by using 0.1 mol x L(-1) borate buffer (pH 8.5) with 12 mmol x L(-1) (2-hydroxypropyl)-gamma-cyclodextrin as chiral selector, a fused-silica capillary with 50 cm effective length (75 microm I.D.), +18 kV applied voltage, a temperature of 20 degrees C and direct UV detection at 280 nm. To avoid comigration or coelution of other similar substances, the flavan-3-ols were isolated and purified using polyamide-solid-phase-extraction and LC-MS analysis. As expected, we found (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin in unfermented, dried, unroasted cocoa beans. In contrast, roasted cocoa beans and cocoa products additionally contained the atypical flavan-3-ol (-)-catechin. This is generally formed during the manufacturing process by an epimerization which converts (-)-epicatechin to its epimer (-)-catechin. High temperatures during the cocoa bean roasting process and particularly the alkalization of the cocoa powder are the main factors inducing the epimerization reaction.

Methyl bromide is cryogenically focussed at -60 degrees C and then eluted by temperature programming. The procedure requires blending of soft samples, e.g. raisins, prunes, or oranges, and ultrasonic homogenization of hard samples, e.g. wheat, cocoa beans, corn, or nuts, with portions of water and ice so the final temperature of the food-water slurry is less than 1 degree C. A 20 g aliquot (4 g food) is then added to a cold headspace vial containing 4 g sodium sulfate.

Some signals of the spectra obtained with both MS techniques could indicate the presence of diacylglycerols in the cocoa extract, but different experimental evidences demonstrated that they were generated by the in-source fragmentation of triglycerides. A nonaqueous reversed-phase chromatographic separation was also developed and used to support the identification of the analytes; nine triacylglycerols were recognized in the cocoa liquor extracts. The three different batches of Ecuador cocoa liquor did not show significant differences in the triacylglycerol profile.",Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS,[],[],Triacylglycerol profile in cocoa liquors using MALDI-TOF and LC-ESI tandem mass spectrometry.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25230186,2015,,,,

The CPs were purified using chromatographic methods and analyzed using HPLC equipped with a fluorescence detector (FLD) and mass spectrometer (MS). The purified CPs had a purity of 53.1% (w/w) and contained procyanidin oligomers (from monomer to decamers) and polymers, with polymers being the predominant component (26.4%, w/w). Different CPs-gelatin-chitosan mass ratios were tested to investigate the effects of formulation on the nanoparticle fabrication. Using CPs-gelatin-chitosan mass ratio of 0.75:1:0.5, the resultant nanoparticles had a particle size of 344.7 nm, zeta-potential of +29.8 mV, particle yield of 51.4%, loading efficiency of 50.1%, and loading capacity of 20.5%. The CPs-gelatin-chitosan nanoparticles were spherical as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) suggested that the primary interaction between the CPs and gelatin was hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction, while electrostatic interaction was the main binding force between chitosan and CPs-gelatin nanoparticles.

This paper deals with the determination of piceid in cocoa-containing products by using photo-induced fluorescence and the aid of a multicommutated continuous-flow assembly which was provided with an on-line photoreactor.

The pre-concentration of the photoproduct of piceid on the solid support greatly improves both sensitivity and selectivity. The influence of different experimental parameters, both chemical (pH, ionic strength) and hydrodynamic (irradiation time, flow rate, photoreactor length, sampling time), was tested. The sample pre-treatment included delipidation with toluene and cyclohexane, stilbene extraction with ethanol/water (80:20, v/v) and clean-up by solid-phase extraction on C(18) cartridges and methanol/water (40:20, v/v) as eluting solution. This procedure allowed the elimination of the aglycon of piceid, resveratrol and other potential interfering species and a recovery of about a 90% piceid.

Precursor ions, based on [M + Li](+)-adduct ions exhibited incomplete fragmentation in the high and low m/z region whereas [M + K](+)-adducts did not show useful fragmentation. Only sodiated precursor ions yielded product ion spectra with structurally diagnostic product ions across the whole m/z range. The high m/z region of the CID spectra is dominated by abundant charge-remote fragmentation of the fatty acid substituents. In favorable cases also positions of double bonds or of hydroxy groups of the fatty acid alkyl chains could be determined. A-type product ions represent the end products of these charge-remote fragmentations. B- and C-type product ions yield the fatty acid composition of individual triacylglycerol species based on loss of either one neutral fatty acid or one sodium carboxylate residue, respectively. Product ions allowing fatty acid substituent positional determination were present in the low m/z range enabling identification of either the sn-1/sn-3 substituents (E-, F-, and G-type ions) or the sn-2 substituent (J-type ion). These findings were demonstrated with synthetic triacylglycerols and plant oils such as cocoa butter, olive oil, and castor bean oil.

Quantification of regioisomers was achieved for TGs containing two different fatty acyl chains (palmitic (P), stearic (S), oleic (O), and/or linoleic (L)). For seven pairs of 'AAB/ABA'-type TGs, namely PPS/PSP, PPO/POP, SSO/SOS, POO/OPO, SOO/OSO, PPL/PLP and LLS/LSL, calibration curves were established on the basis of the difference in relative abundances of the fragment ions produced by preferred losses of the fatty acid from the 1/3-position compared to the 2-position. In practice the positional isomers AAB and ABA yield mass spectra showing a significant difference in relative abundance ratios of the ions AA(+) to AB(+). Statistical analysis of the validation data obtained from analysis of TG standards and spiked oils showed that, under repeatability conditions, least-squares regression can be used to establish calibration curves for all pairs.

Physiological properties of dietary polyphenols have come to the attention in recent years. Especially, proanthocyanidins (ranging from dimers to decamers) have demonstrated potential interactions with biological systems, such as antiviral, antibacterial, molluscicidal, enzyme-inhibiting, antioxidant, and radical-scavenging properties. Agroindustry produces a considerable amount of phenolic-rich sources, and the ability of polyphenolic structures to interacts with other molecules in living organisms confers their beneficial properties. Cocoa wastes and grape seeds and skin byproducts are a source of several phenolic compounds, particularly mono-, oligo-, and polymeric proanthocyanidins.

Emphasis was placed on two casein proteins (_±- and __-casein) and two whey proteins (_±-lactalbumin and __-lactoglobulin). In silico tryptic digestion provided preliminary information about the expected peptides. After tryptic digestion of four milk allergens, the analytical data obtained by combination of reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) led to the identification of 26 peptides. Seven of these peptides were synthesized and used for calibration of the LC-MS/MS system. Species specificity of the selected peptides was sought by BLAST search. Among the selected peptides, only LIVTQTMK from __-lactoglobulin (m/z 467.6, charge 2+) was found to be cow milk specific and could function as a marker.

Three major compounds were purified and two of them were identified by 1H, 13C NMR and mass spectra as (-)-epicatechin (EC) and (+)-catechin (CA). Their antioxidative activity was measured by monitoring the peroxide value of linoleic acid and the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance values of erythrocyte ghost membranes and microsomes. EC and CA had strong antioxidative effects in all three methods, but one unidentified peak was found to be less effective. Additionally, we analyzed the polyphenol concentration of cacao liquor extractions produced in several countries. The total polyphenol concentration was 7.0 to 13.0%, catechin concentration was 0.31 to 0.49%, and epicatechin concentration was 0.35 to 1.68% in the extractions.

With an estimated 800 rooms, Pueblo Bonito is the largest archaeological site in Chaco Canyon and was the center of a large number of interconnected towns and villages spread over northwestern New Mexico. The cacao residues come from pieces of vessels that are likely cylinder jars, special containers occurring almost solely at Pueblo Bonito and deposited in caches at the site. This first known use of cacao drinks north of the Mexican border indicates exchange with cacao cultivators in Mesoamerica in a time frame of about A.D. 1000-1125. The association of cylinder jars and cacao beverages suggests that the Chacoan ritual involving the drinking of cacao was tied to Mesoamerican rituals incorporating cylindrical vases and cacao.

Dentin biomodification was assessed by the modulus of elasticity, mass change, and resistance to enzymatic biodegradation. Extracts with a high polyphenol and PAC content from Vitis vinifera, Theobroma cacao, Camellia sinensis, and Pinus massoniana induced a significant increase in modulus of elasticity and mass. The UHPLC analysis showed the presence of multiple types of polyphenols, ranging from simple phenolic acids to oligomeric PACs and highly condensed tannins. Protective effect against enzymatic degradation was observed for all experimental groups; however, statistically significant differences were observed between plant extracts.

0.43,23022488,"The hemibiotrophic basidiomycete fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa, the causal agent of Witches' broom disease (WBD) in cacao, is able to grow on methanol as the sole carbon source. In plants, one of the main sources of methanol is the pectin present in the structure of cell walls. Pectin is composed of highly methylesterified chains of galacturonic acid. The hydrolysis between the methyl radicals and galacturonic acid in esterified pectin, mediated by a pectin methylesterase (PME), releases methanol, which may be decomposed by a methanol oxidase (MOX). The analysis of the M. pernciosa genome revealed putative mox and pme genes. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR performed with RNA from mycelia grown in the presence of methanol or pectin as the sole carbon source and with RNA from infected cacao seedlings in different stages of the progression of WBD indicate that the two genes are coregulated, suggesting that the fungus may be metabolizing the methanol released from pectin. Moreover, immunolocalization of homogalacturonan, the main pectic domain that constitutes the primary cell wall matrix, shows a reduction in the level of pectin methyl esterification in infected cacao seedlings. Although MOX has been classically classified as a peroxisomal enzyme, M. perniciosa presents an extracellular methanol oxidase. Its activity was detected in the fungus culture supernatants, and mass spectrometry analysis indicated the presence of this enzyme in the fungus secretome. Because M. pernciosa possesses all genes classically related to methanol metabolism, we propose a peroxisome-independent model for the utilization of methanol by this fungus, which begins with the extracellular oxidation of methanol derived from the demethylation of pectin and finishes in the cytosol.",Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,"['D000363', 'D000429', 'D000595', 'D002099', 'D005110', 'D005656', 'D015966', 'D000432', 'D008969', 'D010368', 'D010935', 'D021381', 'D016415']","['Agaricales', 'Alcohol Oxidoreductases', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cacao', 'Extracellular Space', 'Fungal Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Methanol', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pectins', 'Plant Diseases', 'Protein Transport', 'Sequence Alignment']",A potential role for an extracellular methanol oxidase secreted by Moniliophthora perniciosa in Witches' broom disease in cacao.,"['Q000201', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000382', 'Q000201', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000382', None, None]","['enzymology', 'chemistry', None, 'microbiology', 'enzymology', 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'microbiology', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23022488,2013,0,0,,gene

The urine samples were analyzed by UPLC-qTOF-MS, and a partial least-squares discriminant analysis with feature selection was applied to develop a compliance model based on data from 214 urine samples. The optimized model included 52 metabolites and had a misclassification rate of 19% in a validation set containing 139 samples. The metabolites identified in the model were markers of individual foods such as citrus, cocoa-containing products, and fish as well as more general dietary traits such as high fruit and vegetable intake or high intake of heat-treated foods. It was easier to classify the ADD diet than the NND diet probably due to seasonal variation in the food composition of NND and indications of lower compliance among the NND subjects. In conclusion, untargeted metabolomics is a promising approach to develop compliance measures that cover the most important discriminant metabolites of complex diets.

We used gas chromatography with electroantennographic detection and found 12 active compounds derived from three different chocolate types, i.e., plain, nut-containing, and rum-flavored. Eight of the compounds were identified with mass spectrometry, and the activity of three compounds, ethyl vanillin, nonanal, and phenylacetaldehyde (PAA), was subsequently confirmed in both electrophysiological and behavioral assays. In the electroantennogram experiment, PAA and nonanal were consistently eliciting responses in both species and sexes. Ethyl vanillin was active in males of both species, and also in P. interpunctella females. E. cautella females showed no antennal activity in response to ethyl vanillin. All three volatiles were attractive to E. cautella males and P. interpunctella females in a flight tunnel. E. cautella females were significantly attracted only to ethyl vanillin. P. interpunctella males were attracted to PAA. Ethyl vanillin is a novel insect attractant, whereas both nonanal and phenylacetaldehyde mediate behavior in many insect species. A final experiment revealed that a blend of the three volatiles was required to induce landing in the flight tunnel bioassay, and that the landing rate was dependent on dose.

A total of 22 unique PEMs were identified that covered 7 out of 40 investigated food groups (strawberry, cabbages, beetroot, walnut, citrus, green beans and chocolate). The PEMs reflected foods with a distinct composition rather than foods eaten more frequently or in larger amounts. We found that 23__% of the PEMs found in a previous meal study were also valid in the present intervention study.

The effects of adding vitamin E (200 ppm) and rosemary extract (0.1% wt/wt based on fat content) were investigated to prevent lipid oxidation.

The cis-9/trans-11 isomer concentration remained stable through 2 wk of refrigerated storage. A significant loss of both the cis-9/trans-11 and the cis-10/trans-12 isomers occurred after 3 wk of refrigerated storage. The loss was attributed to lipase activity from excessive microbial growth.

0.4,26174671,"The major constituents of agarwood oils are sesquiterpenes that are obtained from isoprenoid precursors through the plastidial methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway and the cytosolic mevalonate pathway. In this study, a novel full-length cDNA of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), which was the second key enzyme in the plastid MEP pathway of sesquiterpenes biosynthesis was isolated from the stem of Aquilaria sinensis (Lour.) Gilg by the methods of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique for the first time, and named as AsDXR. The full-length cDNA of AsDXR was 1768 bp, containing a 1437 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 478 amino acids with a molecular weight of 51.859 kD and the theoretical isoelectric point of 6.29. Comparative and bioinformatic analysis of the deduced AsDXR protein showed extensive homology with DXRs from other plant species, especially Theobroma cacao and Gossypium barbadense, and contained a conserved transit peptide for plastids, and extended pro-rich region and a highly conserved NADPH-binding motif owned by all plant DXRs. Southern blot analysis indicated that AsDXR belonged to a small gene family. Tissue expression pattern analysis revealed that AsDXR expressed strongly in root and stem, but weakly in leaf. Additionally, AsDXR expression was found to be activated by exogenous elicitor of MeJA (methyl jasmonate). The contents of three sesquiterpenes (_±-guaiene, _±-humulene and _-guaiene) were significantly induced by MeJA. This study enables us to further elucidate the role of AsDXR in the biosynthesis of agarwood sesquiterpenes in A. sinensis at the molecular level.

Dietary flavonoids have antioxidant properties and may limit this stress and reduce the risk of these diseases. We used a metabolomic approach to study the influence of catechin, a common flavonoid naturally occurring in various fruits, wine or chocolate, on the metabolic changes induced by hyperlipidemic diets. Male Wistar rats ( n = 8/group) were fed during 6 weeks normolipidemic (5% w/w) or hyperlipidemic (15 and 25%) diets with or without catechin supplementation (0.2% w/w). Urines were collected at days 17 and 38 and analyzed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF). Hyperlipidic diets led to a significant increase of oxidative stress in liver and aorta, upon which catechin had no effect. Multivariate analyses (PCA and PLS-DA) of the urine fingerprints allowed discrimination of the different diets. Variables were then classified according to their dependence on lipid and catechin intake (ANOVA). Nine variables were identified as catechin metabolites of tissular or microbial origin. Around 1000 variables were significantly affected by the lipid content of the diet, and 76 were fully reversed by catechin supplementation. Four variables showing an increase in urinary excretion in rats fed the high-fat diets were identified as deoxycytidine, nicotinic acid, dihydroxyquinoline and pipecolinic acid. After catechin supplementation, the excretion of nicotinic acid was fully restored to the level found in the rats fed the low-fat diet.

The method involved spiking the isotope-substituted internal standard (1-C13 acrylamide) onto 6.00 g of the food product, adding 40 mL distilled/deionized water, and heating at 65 degrees C for 30 min. Afterwards, 10 mL ethylene dichloride was added and the mixture was homogenized for 30 s and centrifuged at 2700 x g for 30 min, and then 8 g supernatant was extracted with 10, 5, and 5 mL portions of ethyl acetate.

Conventional phenotyphic methods can be inadequate for the identification of S.uberis; and in microbiology laboratories S.uberis is confused with the other streptococci and enterococci isolates. Recently, molecular methods are recommended for the accurate identification of S.uberis isolates. The aim of this report is to present a lower respiratory tract infection case caused by S.uberis and the microbiological methods for identification of this bacterium. A 66-year-old male patient with squamous cell lung cancer who received radiotherapy was admitted in our hospital for the control. According to the chest X-Ray, patient was hospitalized with the prediagnosis of ''cavitary tumor, pulmonary abscess''. In the first day of the hospitalization, blood and sputum cultures were drawn. Blood culture was negative, however, Candida albicans was isolated in the sputum culture and it was estimated to be due to oral lesions. After two weeks from the hospitalization, sputum sample was taken from the patient since he had abnormal respiratory sounds and cough complaint. In the Gram stained smear of the sputum there were abundant leucocytes and gram-positive cocci, and S.uberis was isolated in both 5% sheep blood and chocolate agar media. Bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed by VITEK 2 (Biomerieux, France) and also, the bacterium was identified by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) based VITEK MS system as S.uberis. The isolate was determined susceptible to ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, levofloxacin, linezolid, penicillin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, tetracycline and vancomycin. 16S, 23S ribosomal RNA and 16S-23S intergenic spacer gene regions were amplified with specific primers and partial DNA sequence analysis of 16S rRNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were performed by 3500xL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). According to the partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing results, bacterium was confirmed as S.uberis. This report makes a significant contribution to the number of case reports of human infections caused by S.uberis as the identification was performed by current microbiological methods in our case.

Dietary records were also kept by the children's parents for the 7-day sampling period. Individual reported food items were identified, assigned to food groups and, together with known Ni and Zn concentrations of foodstuffs, daily intake rates were calculated. The same method was used for calculations of the energy, fat, protein and carbohydrate intake rates. The levels in the food duplicates, determined by atomic absorption spectrometry, were in the range of 69-2000 microg Ni/kg(dry weight) (geometric mean (GM): 348) and 7.1-43 mg Zn/kg(dry weight) (GM: 17.5). Daily intake rates based on the 294 individual food duplicate analyses were 12-560 microgNi/d (GM: 92.3) and 1.5-11 mgZn/d (GM: 4.63). The results from the dietary records were 35-1050 microg Ni/d (GM: 123) and 1.7-15 mg Zn/d (GM: 5.35). The results of the daily intake rates from both methods showed a correlation with regard to Zn (r=0.56), but no correlation was found between either the Ni intake rates determined with both methods or between the Ni intake rates measured by the duplicate method and calculated intake rates from the dietary records of energy, fat, protein, carbohydrates or drinking water. In the case of nickel, the discrepancies between the methods lead one to suppose that the main factors influencing Ni intake by food are not directly caused by easily assessable food ingredients themselves. It is possible that other factors, such as contaminated drinking water or the transition of Ni from kettles or other household utensils made from stainless steel into the food, may be more relevant. In addition there are some foodstuffs with great variations in concentrations, often influenced by the growing area and environmental factors. Further, some food groups naturally high in Nickel like nuts, cocoa or teas might not have been kept sufficient within the records. In summary, the dietary record method gave sufficient results for Zn, but is insufficient for Ni. Based on the food duplicate analysis, children living in urban areas with consumption of food products from a family-owned garden or the surrounding area and/or products from domestic animals of the surrounding area had about one-third higher Ni levels in their food than children either living in an urban area or children consuming products exclusively from the supermarket.

0.39,29146253,"Strategies for achieving global food security include identification of alternative feedstock for use as animal feed, to contribute towards efforts at increasing livestock farming. The presence of theobromine in cocoa pod husks, a major agro-waste in cocoa-producing countries, hinders its utilisation for this purpose. Cheap treatment of cocoa pod husks to remove theobromine would allow largescale beneficial use of the millions of metric tonnes generated annually. The aim of this study was to isolate theobromine-degrading filamentous fungi that could serve as bioremediation agents for detheobromination of cocoa pod husks. Filamentous fungi were screened for ability to degrade theobromine. The most promising isolates were characterized with respect to optimal environmental conditions for theobromine degradation. Secretion of theobromine-degrading enzymes by the isolates was investigated. Theobromine degradation was monitored by HPLC. Of fourteen theobromine-degrading isolates collected and identified by rDNA 5.8S and ITS sequences, seven belonged to Aspergillus spp. and six were Talaromyces spp. Based on the extent of theobromine utilization, four isolates; Aspergillus niger, Talaromyces verruculosus and two Talaromyces marneffei, showed the best potential for use as bioagents for detheobromination. First-time evidence was found of the use of xanthine oxidase and theobromine oxidase in degradation of a methylxanthine by fungal isolates.

Diagnosis can be confirmed by excluding other causes of cyanosis and by spectrophotometric analysis of blood for methaemoglobin.

However, progress has been limited due the lack of a robust method for the production of amorphous sucrose, with known purity. Poor control has led to the glass transition temperatures (Tg's) for amorphous sucrose varying between 48-78 _C in the literature. Our objective was to investigate the recrystallization of sucrose in the presence of lactose, NaCl and water. The purity of sucrose was confirmed by ion chromatography, polarimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. Amorphous sucrose was prepared by freeze-drying 10% w/v aqueous solutions. Fisher (99.7%) and Silver Spoon (98.4%) sucrose samples melted at 186 _± 0.6 _C & 189 _± 0.3 _C respectively. For the Fisher sample the absence of invert sugars and low mineral content allowed the observation of a small endotherm (___ 150 _C). The Tg of amorphous sucrose was 58.3 _± 1.1 _C with a recrystallization enthalpy (_Hcrys) of 72.8 _± 6.0 J g-1. NaCl reduced both the Tg (54.8 _± 1.8 _C) and the _Hcrys (35.7 _± 3.8 J g-1) without affecting the onset temperature of sucrose's re-crystallization (Tcrys, 129.5 _± 6.9 _C), suggesting that a proportion of the sample remained amorphous. The presence of water (1.6 _± 0.07%) inside the hermetically sealed pans caused an earlier onset of Tg (52.3 _± 1.3 _C) and Tcrys (85.1 _± 4.0 _C), as well as lowering _Hcrys (45.2 _± 2.4 J g-1) compared to samples contained in pin-holed pans (where evaporation was possible).

Serum 25(OH)D___, unlike 25(OH)D___, is not directly influenced by exposure of skin to sun and thus has dietary origins; however, quantifying dietary vitamin D___ is difficult due to the limitations of food composition data. Therefore, the present study aimed to characterise serum 25(OH)D___ concentrations in the participants of the National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS) in Ireland, and to use these serum concentrations to estimate the intake of vitamin D___ using a mathematical modelling approach. Serum 25(OH)D___ concentration was measured by a liquid chromatography-tandem MS method, and information on diet as well as subject characteristics was obtained from the NANS.

We aimed to study interactions between cocoa flavanols (CF) and nitrate, focusing on absorption, bioavailability, excretion, and efficacy to increase endothelial function. In a double-blind randomized, dose-response crossover study, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was measured in 15 healthy subjects before and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after consumption of CF (1.4-10.9 mg/kg bw) or nitrate (0.1-10 mg/kg bw). To study flavanol-nitrate interactions, an additional intervention trial was performed with nitrate and CF taken in sequence at low and high amounts. FMD was measured before (0 h) and at 1h after ingestion of nitrate (3 or 8.5 mg/kg bw) or water. Then subjects received a CF drink (2.7 or 10.9 mg/kg bw) or a micro- and macronutrient-matched CF-free drink. FMD was measured at 1, 2, and 4 h thereafter. Blood and urine samples were collected and assessed for CF and nitric oxide (NO) metabolites with HPLC and gas-phase reductive chemiluminescence. Finally, intragastric formation of NO after CF and nitrate consumption was investigated. Both CF and nitrate induced similar intake-dependent increases in FMD. Maximal values were achieved at 1 h postingestion and gradually decreased to reach baseline values at 4 h. These effects were additive at low intake levels, whereas CF did not further increase FMD after high nitrate intake. Nitrate did not affect flavanol absorption, bioavailability, or excretion, but CF enhanced nitrate-related gastric NO formation and attenuated the increase in plasma nitrite after nitrate intake. Both flavanols and inorganic nitrate can improve endothelial function in healthy subjects at intake amounts that are achievable with a normal diet.

The direct infusion mass spectra of the raw fermented cocoa bean extracts showed 10091 and 10911 peaks, resp., rating cocoa among the most complex organic mixtures ever analyzed. Automated molecular formula calculations could assign 2995 and 2968 of the peaks, resp. to formulae containing only C, H, O, N___3 and S___1 atoms. The formulae were separated into four groups depending on their heteroatom content and the intensities of the groups were compared in class plots, showing the highest population in the CHON species, but the highest abundance in the CHO species. Elemental ratios obtained from the molecular formulae were plotted in an intensity coded three-dimensional modification of the van Krevelen diagram. For the CHO species, the van Krevelen diagram showed that most of the intensity belongs to the lipid, polyphenol and carbohydrate regions of the plot. The biggest difference was observed in the CHON group, assigned as peptide degradation products, where the Ivorian beans showed greater variety and molecular diversity and higher total intensity of the nitrogen containing compounds, in accordance with the fact that the Ivorian beans show generally higher nitrogen content than the Cameroon beans.

Peppers or fruits of Capsicum species rarely have been identified in the paleoethnobotanical record in either Meso- or South America. We report here confirmation of Capsicum sp. residues from pottery samples excavated at Chiapa de Corzo in southern Mexico dated from Middle to Late Preclassic periods (400 BCE to 300 CE). Residues from 13 different pottery types were collected and extracted using standard techniques. Presence of Capsicum was confirmed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)/MS-MS Analysis. Five pottery types exhibited chemical peaks for Capsicum when compared to the standard (dihydrocapsaicin). No peaks were observed in the remaining eight samples. Results of the chemical extractions provide conclusive evidence for Capsicum use at Chiapas de Corzo during a 700 year period (400 BCE-300 CE). Presence of Capsicum in different types of culinary-associated pottery raises questions how chili pepper could have been used during this early time period. As Pre-Columbian cacao products sometimes were flavored using Capsicum, the same pottery sample set was tested for evidence of cacao using a theobromine marker: these results were negative. As each vessel that tested positive for Capsicum had a culinary use we suggest here the possibility that chili residues from the Chiapas de Corzo pottery samples reflect either paste or beverage preparations for religious, festival, or every day culinary use. Alternatively, some vessels that tested positive merely could have been used to store peppers. Most interesting from an archaeological context was the presence of Capsicum residue obtained from a spouted jar, a pottery type previously thought only to be used for pouring liquids.

The proposed method makes use of a modified QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rigged, and safe) procedure that combines isolation of the pesticides and sample clean-up in a single step. Analysis is performed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry operated in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, acquiring two specific precursor-product ion transitions per target compound. Two main fragment ions for each pesticide were obtained to achieve the identification according to the SANCO guidelines 10684/2009. The method was validated with various food samples, including edible oil, meat, egg, cheese, chocolate, coffee, rice, tree nuts, citric fruits, vegetables, etc. No significant matrix effect was observed for tested pesticides, therefore, matrix-matched calibration was not necessary. Calibration curves were linear and covered from 1 to 20 microg L(-1) for all compounds studied. The average recoveries, measured at 10 microg kg(-1), were in the range 70-120% for all of the compounds tested with relative standard deviations below 20%, while a value of 10 microg kg(-1) has been established as the method limit of quantitation (MLOQ) for all target analytes. Similar trueness and precision results were also obtained for spiking at 200 microg kg(-1). Expanded uncertainty values were in the range 21-27% while the HorRat ratios were below 1.

Several chemical modifiers were tested during method development, and analytical parameters, including the limits of detection and quantification as well as the accuracy and precision of the overall procedure, were assessed. The study examined 30 chocolate samples, and the concentrations of Cd and Pb were in the range of <1.7-107.6 and <21-138.4 ng/g, respectively. The results indicated that dark chocolates have higher concentrations of Cd and Pb than milk and white chocolates. Furthermore, samples with five different cocoa contents (ranging from 34 to 85%) from the same brand were analyzed, and linear correlations between the cocoa content and the concentrations of Cd (R(2) = 0.907) and Pb (R(2) = 0.955) were observed.

Considering the variety and complexity of such materials, compositional data and compliant methodology is still undergoing many updates and improvements. Present study evaluated sugar beet pulp (SBP), walnut shell (WS), cocoa bean husk (CBH), onion peel (OP) and pea pods (PP) as potentially valuable materials for carbohydrate recovery. Macrocomponent analyses revealed carbohydrate fraction as the most abundant, dominating in dietary fibres. Upon complete acid hydrolysis of sample alcohol insoluble residues, developed procedures of high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one pre-column derivatization (PMP-derivatization) were used for carbohydrate monomeric composition determination. HPTLC exhibited good qualitative features useful for multi-sample rapid analysis, while HPLC superior separation and quantification characteristics. Distinctive monomeric patterns were obtained among samples. OP, SBP and CBH, due to the high galacturonic acid content (20.81%, 13.96% and 6.90% dry matter basis, respectively), may be regarded as pectin sources, while WS and PP as materials abundant in xylan-rich hemicellulose (total xylan content 15.53%, 9.63% dry matter basis, respectively).

This study evaluated the influence of packaging atmosphere, storage temperature, and storage time on WMP shelf-life using sensory and instrumental techniques. Two commercial batches of WMP were repackaged in plastic laminate pouches with air or nitrogen and stored at 2 degrees C or 23 degrees C for 1 yr. Descriptive analysis was conducted using a 10-member trained panel; volatile analysis was performed using solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Consumer acceptance (n = 75) was conducted every 3 mo with reconstituted WMP and white and milk chocolate made from each treatment. Data were analyzed using ANOVA with Fisher's LSD, Pearson correlation analysis, and principal component analysis. Air-stored WMP had higher peroxide values, lipid oxidation volatiles, and grassy and painty flavors than nitrogen-flushed WMP. Storage temperature did not affect levels of straight chain lipid oxidation volatiles; 23 degrees C storage resulted in higher cooked and milkfat flavors and lower levels of grassy flavor compared with 2 degrees C storage. Consumer acceptance was negatively correlated with lipid oxidation volatiles and painty flavor. Nitrogen flushing prevented the development of painty flavor in WMP stored up to 1 yr at either temperature, resulting in chocolate with high consumer acceptance. Nitrogen flushing can be applied to extend the shelf life of WMP for use in chocolate; storage temperature also plays a role, but to a lesser extent.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000328', 'D000818', 'D002099', 'D003116', 'D005511', 'D005524', 'D006801', 'D008875', 'D008892', 'D009584', 'D010100', 'D010545', 'D025341', 'D013649', 'D013696', 'D055815']","['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cacao', 'Color', 'Food Handling', 'Food Technology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Milk', 'Nitrogen', 'Oxygen', 'Peroxides', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Taste', 'Temperature', 'Young Adult']",Effect of nitrogen flushing and storage temperature on flavor and shelf-life of whole milk powder.,"[None, None, 'Q000592', None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 'standards', None, 'methods', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19447973,2009,,,,no pdf access

This study explored links between urinary cadmium levels and consumption frequency of these traditional foods and piloted a community-based methodology to identify potential determinants of cadmium exposure and accumulation. Consultations led to selection of one community for study from which 60 women aged 30 to 50 years participated in health and food frequency survey, urine collection and a routine health check. Urinary cadmium levels were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry; data were analysed using SPSS-14. The geometric mean cadmium level in this group of women was 1.17 (arithmetic mean 1.86) microg/g creatinine with one-third exceeding 2.0 microg/g creatinine. Heavy smoking (>or=300 pack years) was linked to higher cadmium in urine, as was increasing age and waist circumference. Analysis of age-adjusted residuals revealed significant associations (P<0.05) between cadmium level and higher consumption of turtle liver and kidney, locally gathered clams, peanuts, coconut, chocolate and potato chips. Dugong kidney consumption approached significance (P=0.06). Multiple regression revealed that 40% (adjusted r(2)) of variation in cadmium level was explained by the sum of these associated foods plus heavy smoking, age and waist circumference. No relationships between cadmium and pregnancy history were found.

0.34,21279669,"Gallic acid (GA), a key intermediate in the synthesis of plant hydrolysable tannins, is also a primary anti-inflammatory, cardio-protective agent found in wine, tea, and cocoa. In this publication, we reveal the identity of a gene and encoded protein essential for GA synthesis. Although it has long been recognized that plants, bacteria, and fungi synthesize and accumulate GA, the pathway leading to its synthesis was largely unknown. Here we provide evidence that shikimate dehydrogenase (SDH), a shikimate pathway enzyme essential for aromatic amino acid synthesis, is also required for GA production. Escherichia coli (E. coli) aroE mutants lacking a functional SDH can be complemented with the plant enzyme such that they grew on media lacking aromatic amino acids and produced GA in vitro. Transgenic Nicotiana tabacum lines expressing a Juglans regia SDH exhibited a 500% increase in GA accumulation.

For all the finished products, the same simple sample preparation may be applied: ultrasound-assisted extraction in 10 mL methanol for 30 min followed by centrifugation. The Rf values of individual HPTLC bands afford preliminary identification of potential PDE5-Is. Scanning densitometry capabilities enable comparison of the unknown UV spectra with those of known standard compounds and allow further structural insight. Mass spectrometric analysis of the material derived from individual zones supplies an additional degree of confidence. Significantly, the proposed screening technique allows focus on the already known PDE5 Is and provides a platform for isolation and chemical categorization of the newly-synthesized analogs. Furthermore, the scope could be expanded to other therapeutic categories (e.g., analgesics, antidiabetics, and anorexiants) that are occasionally coadulterated along with the PDE5-Is. The method was successfully applied to screening of 45 commercial lifestyle products.

0.34,12696960,"Partial least squares regression (PLSR) models able to predict some of the wine aroma nuances from its chemical composition have been developed. The aromatic sensory characteristics of 57 Spanish aged red wines were determined by 51 experts from the wine industry. The individual descriptions given by the experts were recorded, and the frequency with which a sensory term was used to define a given wine was taken as a measurement of its intensity. The aromatic chemical composition of the wines was determined by already published gas chromatography (GC)-flame ionization detector and GC-mass spectrometry methods. In the whole, 69 odorants were analyzed. Both matrixes, the sensory and chemical data, were simplified by grouping and rearranging correlated sensory terms or chemical compounds and by the exclusion of secondary aroma terms or of weak aroma chemicals. Finally, models were developed for 18 sensory terms and 27 chemicals or groups of chemicals. Satisfactory models, explaining more than 45% of the original variance, could be found for nine of the most important sensory terms (wood-vanillin-cinnamon, animal-leather-phenolic, toasted-coffee, old wood-reduction, vegetal-pepper, raisin-flowery, sweet-candy-cacao, fruity, and berry fruit). For this set of terms, the correlation coefficients between the measured and predicted Y (determined by cross-validation) ranged from 0.62 to 0.81. Models confirmed the existence of complex multivariate relationships between chemicals and odors. In general, pleasant descriptors were positively correlated to chemicals with pleasant aroma, such as vanillin, beta damascenone, or (E)-beta-methyl-gamma-octalactone, and negatively correlated to compounds showing less favorable odor properties, such as 4-ethyl and vinyl phenols, 3-(methylthio)-1-propanol, or phenylacetaldehyde.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002849', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D016018', 'D008956', 'D009812', 'D012044', 'D013649', 'D014920']","['Chromatography, Gas', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Models, Chemical', 'Odorants', 'Regression Analysis', 'Taste', 'Wine']",Prediction of aged red wine aroma properties from aroma chemical composition.

This study aimed to analyze the effect of consuming ready-to-eat meals containing a cocoa extract, within an energy restricted diet on urinary metabolomic changes. Fifty middle-aged volunteers [30.6 (2.3) kg m(-2)] participated in a 4-week randomised, parallel and double-blind study. Half consumed meals supplemented with 1.4 g of cocoa extract (645 mg polyphenols) while the remaining subjects received meals without cocoa supplementation. Ready-to-eat meals were included within a 15% energy restricted diet. Urine samples (24 h) were collected at baseline and after 4 weeks and were analyzed by high-performance-liquid chromatography-time-of-flight-mass-spectrometry (HPLC-TOF-MS) in negative and positive ionization modes followed by multivariate analysis. The relationship between urinary metabolites was evaluated by the Spearman correlation test. Interestingly, the principal component analysis discriminated among the baseline group, control group at the endpoint and cocoa group at the endpoint (p < 0.01), although in the positive ionization mode the baseline and control groups were not well distinguished. Metabolites were related to theobromine metabolism (3-methylxanthine and 3-methyluric acid), food processing (L-beta-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine), flavonoids (2,5,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyflavanone-5-O-glucoside and 7,4'-dimethoxy-6-C-methylflavanone), catecholamine (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol-sulphate) and endogenous metabolism (uridine monophosphate). These metabolites were present in higher (p < 0.001) amounts in the cocoa group. 3-Methylxanthine and l-beta-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine were confirmed with standards. Interestingly, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol-sulphate was positively correlated with 3-methylxanthine (rho = 0.552; p < 0.001) and 7,4'-dimethoxy-6-C-methylflavanone (rho = 447; p = 0.002).

These results suggest that the antiulcer mechanism of CWSP was not only radical scavenging but also modulation of leukocyte function.","Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry","['D000818', 'D000897', 'D000975', 'D002099', 'D002851', 'D002927', 'D004305', 'D000431', 'D005419', 'D005753', 'D015227', 'D008297', 'D009195', 'D010636', 'D011108', 'D059808', 'D051381', 'D017207', 'D013276', 'D013392', 'D017392', 'D014527', 'D014810', 'D014969']","['Animals', 'Anti-Ulcer Agents', 'Antioxidants', 'Cacao', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cimetidine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ethanol', 'Flavonoids', 'Gastric Mucosa', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Male', 'Peroxidase', 'Phenols', 'Polymers', 'Polyphenols', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Stomach Ulcer', 'Sucralfate', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances', 'Uric Acid', 'Vitamin E', 'Xanthine Oxidase']",Effects of polyphenol substances derived from Theobroma cacao on gastric mucosal lesion induced by ethanol.,"[None, 'Q000494', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000009', None, 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000037', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', None, None, None, 'Q000188', 'Q000494', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000494', 'Q000037']","[None, 'pharmacology', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'pharmacology', None, 'adverse effects', None, 'drug effects', None, None, 'antagonists & inhibitors', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', None, None, None, 'drug therapy', 'pharmacology', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'pharmacology', 'antagonists & inhibitors']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9757560,1998,0,0,,year

Recently, it was published that calcium oxalate accumulates in infected cacao tissues during the progression of Witches' Broom disease (WBD). In the present work we report that the hemibiotrophic basidiomycete Moniliophthora perniciosa, the causal agent of WBD, produces calcium oxalate crystals. These crystals were initially observed by polarized light microscopy of hyphae growing on a glass slide, apparently being secreted from the cells. The analysis was refined by Scanning electron microscopy and the compositon of the crystals was confirmed by energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometry. The production of oxalate by M. perniciosa was reinforced by the identification of a putative gene coding for oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of oxaloacetate to oxalate and acetate. This gene was shown to be expressed in the biotrophic-like mycelia, which in planta occupy the intercellular middle-lamella space, a region filled with pectin. Taken together, our results suggest that oxalate production by M. perniciosa may play a role in the WBD pathogenesis mechanism.",Current microbiology,"['D000363', 'D000595', 'D000818', 'D002099', 'D002129', 'D005656', 'D006867', 'D025301', 'D008855', 'D008859', 'D008969', 'D010935', 'D016415', 'D013052']","['Agaricales', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cacao', 'Calcium Oxalate', 'Fungal Proteins', 'Hydrolases', 'Hyphae', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microscopy, Polarization', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plant Diseases', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission']","Production of calcium oxalate crystals by the basidiomycete Moniliophthora perniciosa, the causal agent of witches' broom disease of Cacao.","['Q000737', None, None, 'Q000382', 'Q000378', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000382', None, None]","['chemistry', None, None, 'microbiology', 'metabolism', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'microbiology', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18172716,2008,0,0,,

The isoflavone content varied from 2.4 to 18.1 mg/100 g (FW), and soy kibe and soy sausage presented the highest amounts. Chocolate had the highest antioxidant capacity, but this fact was probably associated with the addition of cocoa liquor, a well-known source of polyphenolics. This study showed that the soy-based foods do not present a significant content of isoflavones when compared with the grain, and their in vitro antioxidant capacity is not related with these compounds but rather to the presence of other phenolics and synthetic antioxidants, such as sodium erythorbate.

Recent reports indicate that the main flavonoids found in cocoa, flavan-3-ols and their oligomeric derivatives, procyanidins, have a variety of beneficial actions, including antioxidant protection and modulation of vascular homeostasis. These findings are supported by similar research on other flavonoid-rich foods. Other constituents in cocoa and chocolate that may also influence cardiovascular health are briefly reviewed. The lipid content of chocolate is relatively high; however, one third of the lipid in cocoa butter is composed of the fat stearic acid, which exerts a neutral cholesterolemic response in humans. Cocoa and chocolate contribute to trace mineral intake, which is necessary for optimum functioning of all biologic systems and for vascular tone. Thus, multiple components in chocolate, particularly flavonoids, can contribute to the complex interplay of nutrition and health.

Measurements using a high-pressure liquid chromatography method (HPLC), give reproducible results. The levels of pyridostigmine in the serum or plasma of healthy controls and of patients show no essential differences. Components of coffee, tea, chocolate and cigarettes can markedly disturb the chromatography by adding additional peaks, so that interpretation becomes difficult or impossible. Blood levels can be measured approximately one hour after oral intake of 60 mg pyridostigmine. Concentrations rise for two to four hours and then decline exponentially. The half-life of pyridostigmine was between 156 and 210 minutes. Despite identical oral dosages, the concentration differed intraindividually and interindividually among patients. While the blood level does not reach its maximum value for 1-1 1/2 to 3 hours, the maximum clinical and neurophysiological effect of pyridostigmine appears 30-60 minutes after ingestion. Variable distribution of cholinesterase inhibitors over the different compartments (blood, synaptic region) is assumed to cause this temporal lag. If the total amount of pyridostigmine is divided into 4-5 doses, the concentration profiles over the course of a day are relatively stable. There is no significant correlation between the variations in blood level throughout one day, and changes in myasthenic symptomatology. Effects of pyridostigmine can be measured at levels as low as 5 ng/ml; at levels above 40 ng/ml further improvement can be detected only rarely.

0.32,20722952,"Export of cocoa beans is of great economic importance in Ghana and several other tropical countries. Raw cocoa has an astringent, unpleasant taste, and flavor, and has to be fermented, dried, and roasted to obtain the characteristic cocoa flavor and taste. In an attempt to obtain a deeper understanding of the changes in the cocoa beans during fermentation and investigate the possibility of future development of objective methods for assessing the degree of fermentation, a novel combination of methods including cut test, colorimetry, fluorescence spectroscopy, NIR spectroscopy, and GC-MS evaluated by chemometric methods was used to examine cocoa beans sampled at different durations of fermentation and samples representing fully fermented and dried beans from all cocoa growing regions of Ghana. Using colorimetry it was found that samples moved towards higher a* and b* values as fermentation progressed. Furthermore, the degree of fermentation could, in general, be well described by the spectroscopic methods used. In addition, it was possible to link analysis of volatile compounds with predictions of fermentation time. Fermented and dried cocoa beans from the Volta and the Western regions clustered separately in the score plots based on colorimetric, fluorescence, NIR, and GC-MS indicating regional differences in the composition of Ghanaian cocoa beans. The study demonstrates the potential of colorimetry and spectroscopic methods as valuable tools for determining the fermentation degree of cocoa beans. Using GC-MS it was possible to demonstrate the formation of several important aroma compounds such 2-phenylethyl acetate, propionic acid, and acetoin and the breakdown of others like diacetyl during fermentation.

In this study, the effect of different proanthocyanidin-rich extracts, which were obtained from cocoa (CCX), French maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol extract, PYC) and grape seed (GSPE), on lipid homeostasis was evaluated. Hepatic human cells (HepG2 cells) were treated with 25 mg/L of CCX, PYC or GSPE. We also performed in vitro experiments to assess the effect on lipid synthesis that is induced by the bioactive GSPE proanthocyanidins using the physiological metabolites that are present in the serum of GSPE-administered rats. For this, Wistar rats were administered 1 g/kg of GSPE, and serum was collected after 2 h. The semipurified serum of GSPE-administered rats was fully characterized by liquid chromatography tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-QqQ/MS(2)). The lipids studied in the analyses were free cholesterol (FC), cholesterol ester (CE) and triglycerides (TG). All three proanthocyanidin-rich extracts induced a remarkable decrease in the de novo lipid synthesis in HepG2 cells.

0.31,22417537,"Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) is rich in procyanidins, a large portion of which degrades during the natural fermentation process of producing cocoa powder. Recent advances in technology have enabled scientists to produce unfermented cocoa powder, preserving the original profile of procyanidins present in cocoa and allowing for the development of highly concentrated procyanidin-rich extracts. During this process, the anthocyanins naturally present in unfermented cocoa remain intact, producing a violet color in the final extract. The objective of this study was to selectively remove the violet color in procyanidin-rich extracts produced from unfermented cocoa powder, while maintaining the stability and composition of procyanidins present in the matrix. Several processing parameters, including pH fluctuations, enzymatic treatments, and the addition of potassium meta-bisulfite, were explored to influence the color of procyanidin-rich extracts throughout a 60-d shelf life study. The addition of potassium meta-bisulfite (500 ppm) was found to be the most effective means of removing the violet color present in the treated extracts (L*= 71.39, a*= 8.44, b*= 9.61, chroma = 12.79, and hue = 48.8_) as compared to the control (L*= 52.84, a*= 11.08, b*= 2.24, chroma = 11.28, and hue = 11.4_).

Each child received two test meals labeled with 5.6 mg 57Fe and 3.0 mg 58Fe as ferrous sulfate on 2 consecutive days. Three different doses of ascorbic acid (0, 25, and 50 mg per 25-g serving) were evaluated in two separate studies by using a crossover design. Iron isotope ratios were measured by negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry. In the first study, iron absorption was significantly greater (P < 0.0001) after the addition of 25 mg ascorbic acid: geometric mean iron absorption was 1.6% (range: 0.9-4.2%) and 5.1% (2.2-17.3%) for the test meals containing 0 and 25 mg ascorbic acid, respectively. In the second study, a significant difference (P < 0.05) in iron absorption was observed when the ascorbic acid content was increased from 25 to 50 mg: geometric mean iron absorption was 5.4% (range: 2.7-10.8%) compared with 7.7% (range: 4.7-16.5%), respectively.

Vitamin B12 is extracted in sodium acetate buffer in the presence of sodium cyanide (100 degrees C, 30 min). After purification and concentration with an immunoaffinity column, vitamin B12 is determined by liquid chromatography with UV detection (361 nm). The method has been validated in analyses of a large range of products: milk- and soy-based infant formulas, cereals, cocoa beverages, health care products, and polyvitamin premixes.

Inadequate storage, especially with temperature fluctuations, may lead to rearrangement of triglycerides that make up the bulk of the chocolate matrix; this rearrangement may lead to fat bloom. Bloom is the main cause of quality loss in the chocolate industry. The effect of storage conditions leading to bloom formation on texture and flavor attributes by human and instrumental measures has yet to be reported. Therefore, the impact of storage conditions on the quality of dark chocolate by sensory and instrumental measurements was determined. Dark chocolate was kept under various conditions and analyzed at 0, 4, and 8 wk of storage. Ten members of a descriptive panel analyzed texture and flavor. Instrumental methods included texture analysis, color measurement, lipid polymorphism by X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry, triglyceride concentration by gas chromatography, and surface properties by atomic force microscopy. Results were treated by analysis of variance, cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and linear partial least squares regression analysis. Chocolate stored 8 wk at high temperature without fluctuations and 4 wk with fluctuations transitioned from form V to VI. Chocolates stored at high temperature with and without fluctuations were harder, more fracturable, more toothpacking, had longer melt time, were less sweet, and had less cream flavor. These samples had rougher surfaces, fewer but larger grains, and a heterogeneous surface. Overall, all stored dark chocolate experienced instrumental or perceptual changes attributed to storage condition. Chocolates stored at high temperature with and without fluctuations were most visually and texturally compromised.

These foods include bread and other bakery products, crisps, chips, breakfast cereals, and coffee. To date, the diminutive size of acrylamide (71.08 Da) has prevented the development of screening immunoassays for this chemical. In this study, a polyclonal antibody capable of binding the carcinogen was produced by the synthesis of an immunogen comprising acrylamide derivatised with 3-mercaptobenzoic acid (3-MBA), and its conjugation to the carrier protein bovine thyroglobulin. Antiserum from the immunised rabbit was harvested and fully characterised. It displayed no binding affinity for acrylamide or 3-MBA but had a high affinity for 3-MBA-derivitised acrylamide. The antisera produced was utilised in the development of an ELISA based detection system for acrylamide. Spiked water samples were assayed for acrylamide content using a previously published extraction method validated for coffee, crispbread, potato, milk chocolate and potato crisp matrices.

Several kinds of foods (industrially produced) representing different food/product groups available on the Swedish market have been analysed for acrylamide. A considerable variation in levels of acrylamide between single foodstuffs (different brands) within food categories were found, which also applies for levels in different food categories. Using recent Swedish food consumption data the dietary intake of acrylamide for the Swedish adult population was assessed based on foodstuffs with low to high levels of acrylamide (<30-2300 microg/kg), such as processed potato products, bread, breakfast cereals, biscuits, cookies, snacks and coffee. The estimated dietary intake of acrylamide per person (total population) given as the 5th, 50th and 95th percentile were 9.1, 27 and 62 microg/day respectively, from those food/product groups (mean 31 microg/day). No acrylamide was found in many other foodstuffs analysed and those were therefore not included in the dietary intake assessment of acrylamide. However, an additional minor contribution of a few microg/day of acrylamide from foods/products like poultry, meat, fish, cocoa powder and chocolates cannot be excluded.

Several hundred protein spots were resolved on each tissue analysis, of which 72 variable spots were subjected to MS analysis, resulting in 49 identifications. The identified proteins represent an array of functional categories, including seed storage, stress response, photosynthesis and translation factors. The seed storage protein was strongly accumulated in cacao zygotic embryos compared to their somatic counterpart. However, sucrose treatment (60 g L(-1)) allows up-regulation of storage protein in SE. A high similarity in the profiles of acidic proteins was observed in mature zygotic and somatic embryos.

These metabolites, chemically different from the aglycone forms found in foods, are the compounds that reach the circulatory system and the target organs. Therefore, it is imperative to identify and quantify these circulating metabolites to investigate their roles in the biological effects associated with (-)-epicatechin intake. Using authentic synthetic standards of (-)-epicatechin sulfates, glucuronides, and O-methyl sulfates, a novel LC-MS/MS-MRM analytical methodology to quantify (-)-epicatechin metabolites in biological matrices was developed and validated. The optimized method was subsequently applied to the analysis of plasma and urine metabolites after consumption of dark chocolate, an (-)-epicatechin-rich food, by humans.

Despite the advantages of such controlled fermentations, the fermentation involved in the production of chocolate is still a spontaneous process that relies on the natural microbiota at cocoa farms. However, recent studies indicate that certain thermotolerant Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures can be used as starter cultures for cocoa pulp fermentation. In this study, we investigate the potential of specifically developed starter cultures to modulate chocolate aroma. Specifically, we developed several new S. cerevisiae hybrids that combine thermotolerance and efficient cocoa pulp fermentation with a high production of volatile flavor-active esters. In addition, we investigated the potential of two strains of two non-Saccharomyces species that produce very large amounts of fruity esters (Pichia kluyveri and Cyberlindnera fabianii) to modulate chocolate aroma. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the cocoa liquor revealed an increased concentration of various flavor-active esters and a decrease in spoilage-related off-flavors in batches inoculated with S. cerevisiae starter cultures and, to a lesser extent, in batches inoculated with P. kluyveri and Cyb. fabianii. Additionally, GC-MS analysis of chocolate samples revealed that while most short-chain esters evaporated during conching, longer and more-fat-soluble ethyl and acetate esters, such as ethyl octanoate, phenylethyl acetate, ethyl phenylacetate, ethyl decanoate, and ethyl dodecanoate, remained almost unaffected.

Cocoa polyphenolic antioxidants seem to be the best candidates for those effects. However, data regarding polyphenol metabolites in tissues after a long-term cocoa intake are scarce. In the present study we mainly focus on the uptake and accumulation of epicatechin metabolites in lymphoid organs, including the thymus, spleen and mesenteric lymphoid nodes, as well as in the liver and testes after a diet rich in cocoa. Ten young weaned Wistar rats were fed randomly with a 10 % (w/w) cocoa diet or a control diet for 3 weeks, corresponding to their infancy and youth.

Epidemiological studies have shown that a flavonoid-rich diet is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. The majority of the flavonoids survive intact until they reach the colon where they are then extensively metabolized into smaller fragments. Here, we describe the development of GC-MS-based methods for the profiling of phenolic microbial fermentation products in urine, plasma, and fecal water. Furthermore, the methods are applicable for profiling products obtained from in vitro batch culture fermentation models. The methods incorporate enzymatic deconjugation, liquid-liquid extraction, derivatization, and subsequent analysis by GC-MS. At the level of individual compounds, the methods gave recoveries better than 80% with inter-day precision being better than 20%, depending on the matrix. Limits of detection were below 0.1 microg/ml for most phenolic acids. The newly developed methods were successfully applied to samples from human and in-vitro intervention trials, studying the metabolic impact of flavonoid intake.

The main aim of this study was to test if there is difference in polyphenol content, antioxidant capacity, and antimicrobial activity between nonalkalized and alkalized cocoa powders. To estimate polyphenol and flavonoid content in cocoa samples the spectrophotometric microassays were used. Flavan-3ols were determined with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Antimicrobial activity against 3 Gram positive bacteria, 4 Gram negative bacteria and 1 strain of yeast was determined using broth microdilution method. Total polyphenol content was 1.8 times lower in alkalized cocoa samples than in natural ones. Epicatechin/catechin ratio was changed due to the process of alkalization in favor of catechin (2.21 in natural and 1.45 in alkalized cocoa powders). Combined results of 3 antioxidative tests (DPPH, FRAP, ABTS) were used for calculation of RACI (Relative Antioxidant Capacity Index) and GAS (Global Antioxidant Score) values that were consistently higher in natural than in alkalized cocoa extracts. Obtained results have shown significant correlations between these values and phenolic content (0.929 ___ r ___ 0.957, P < 0.01).

0.22,10917931,"Diets that are rich in plant foods have been associated with a decreased risk for specific disease processes and certain chronic diseases. In addition to essential macronutrients and micronutrients, the flavonoids in a variety of plant foods may have health-enhancing properties. Chocolate is a food that is known to be rich in the flavan-3-ol epicatechin and procyanidin oligomers. However, the bioavailability and the biological effects of the chocolate flavonoids are poorly understood. To begin to address these issues, we developed a method based on HPLC coupled with electrochemical (coulometric) detection to determine the physiological levels of epicatechin, catechin and epicatechin dimers. This method allows for the determination of 20 pg (69 fmol) of epicatechin, which translates to plasma concentrations as low as 1 nmol/L. We next evaluated the absorption of epicatechin, from an 80-g semisweet chocolate (procyanidin-rich chocolate) bolus. By 2 h after ingestion, there was a 12-fold increase in plasma epicatechin, from 22 to 257 nmol/L (P < 0.01).

In vitro, the flavanols and the procyanidin oligomers exhibited dose-dependent protection against 2,2'-azo-bis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced erythrocyte hemolysis between concentrations of 2.5 and 40 microM. Dimer, trimer, and tetramer showed the strongest inhibitory effects at 10 microM, 59.4%, 66.2%, 70.9%; 20 microM, 84.1%, 87.6%, 81.0%; and 40 microM, 90.2%, 88.9%, 78.6%, respectively. In a subsequent experiment, male Sprague-Dawley rats (approximately 200 g; n = 5-6) were given a 100-mg intragastric dose of a cocoa extract. Blood was collected over a 4-hr time period.

The bitterness intensities of mixtures of the dry syrups and acidic jellies were significantly greater than those of water suspensions of the dry syrups in human gustatory sensation tests. On the other hand, the mixture with a chocolate jelly, which has a neutral pH, was less bitter than water suspensions of the dry syrups. The bitterness intensities predicted by the taste sensor output values correlated well with the observed bitterness intensities in human gustatory sensation tests. When the concentrations of CAM and AZM in solutions extracted from physical mixtures of dry syrup and jelly were determined by HPLC, concentrations in the solutions extracted from mixtures with acidic jellies were higher than those from mixtures with a neutral jelly (almost 90 times higher for CAM, and almost 7-10 times higher for AZM). Thus, bitterness suppression is correlated with the pH of the jelly. Finally, a drug dissolution test for dry syrup with and without jelly was performed using the paddle method. There was no significance difference in dissolution profile. It was concluded the appropriate choice of jelly with the right pH is essential for taste masking.

0.16,20153860,"Quality control of cacao beans is a significant issue in the chocolate industry. In this report, we describe how moisture damage to cacao beans alters the volatile chemical signature of the beans in a way that can be tracked quantitatively over time. The chemical signature of the beans is monitored via sampling the headspace of the vapor above a given bean sample. Headspace vapor sampled with solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) was detected and analyzed with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS). Cacao beans from six geographical origins (Costa Rica, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama) were analyzed. Twenty-nine analytes that change in concentration levels via the time-dependent moisture damage process were measured using chemometric software. Biomarker analytes that were independent of geographical origin were found. Furthermore, prediction algorithms were used to demonstrate that moisture damage could be verified before there were visible signs of mold by analyzing subsets of the 29 analytes. Thus, a quantitative approach to quality screening related to the identification of moisture damage in the absence of visible mold is presented.",Journal of chromatography.

From January to November 1992, in the first 24 hours after delivery, 1,205 mothers (401 cases and 804 controls) were interviewed and their newborns were examined to assess birth weight and gestational age by means of the method of Capurro et al. (J Pediatr 1978;93:120-2). The cases were children with birth weight < 2,500 g and gestational age > or = 28 weeks. Cases and controls were matched for time of birth and hospital of delivery and were recruited from the four maternity hospitals in Pelotas, southern Brazil. Daily maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy for each trimester was estimated. To assess caffeine intake, 10% of the mothers were reinterviewed at their households and samples of reported information on drip coffee and mat© (a caffeine-containing drink widely used in South America) were collected and sent to the laboratory for caffeine determination through liquid chromatography. When instant coffee was reported, the weight of powder was measured using a portable scale, and caffeine intake was estimated from a reference table. Caffeine intake from tea, chocolate, soft drinks, and medicines was estimated from a reference table. Analyses were performed by conditional logistic regression. Crude analyses showed no effect of caffeine on low birth weight, preterm births or intrauterine growth retardation.

0.14,16954822,"A proteomic analysis of procyanidin B(2) isolated from cocoa against oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced lipid-laden macrophage formation was performed. Of approximately 400 detected proteins, 12 were differentially expressed as a result of B(2) treatment. They were subsequently identified by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry and the SWISS-PROT database. Further reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis revealed that B(2) strongly inhibited arachidonic acid inflammatory reactions, apoptosis, and their coupled mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-kappaB pathways. To highlight proteins or genes with similar expressed patterns and similarly biological function induced by B(2) in lipid-laden macrophages, a cluster and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis were performed. The data were mapped to multiple pathways. Further validation of the bioinformatic results revealed that activation of Wnt signaling may contribute to the cardioprotection of B(2). The differentially expressed genes and proteins mentioned above induced by B(2) are through regulating nuclear transcription factors, activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and inhibiting AP-1 mRNA expressions. These in vitro data help to interpret the beneficial effects of B(2) in reducing the risk of atherosclerosis after consumption of flavonoid-rich foods. Many differentially expressed genes induced by B(2) help to uncover novel targets and may help to target disease interactions in atherosclerosis in the future.",Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology,"['D000595', 'D001094', 'D044946', 'D002392', 'D051546', 'D019281', 'D004734', 'D015870', 'D006801', 'D050356', 'D008077', 'D008264', 'D008969', 'D047495', 'D044945', 'D012333', 'D051127', 'D015398', 'D020298', 'D051153']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase', 'Biflavonoids', 'Catechin', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Dimerization', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, LDL', 'Macrophages', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'PPAR gamma', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Scavenger Receptors, Class E', 'Signal Transduction', 'U937 Cells', 'Wnt Proteins']",Inhibitory effects of procyanidin B(2) dimer on lipid-laden macrophage formation.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000187', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000494', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000502', 'Q000494', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000502']","[None, 'analysis', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'analysis', None, None, 'drug effects', None, 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', 'drug effects', None, 'physiology', 'pharmacology', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'drug effects', None, 'physiology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16954822,2006,0,0,,

The objective of the study was to evaluate the possible effect of milk on the excretion of (2)-epicatechin metabolites from cocoa powder after its ingestion with and without milk. Twenty-one volunteers received the following three test meals each in a randomised cross-over design with a 1-week interval between meals: (1) 250 ml whole milk as a control; (2) 40 g cocoa powder dissolved in 250 ml whole milk (CC-M); (3) 40 g cocoa powder dissolved in 250 ml water (CC-W). Urine was collected before consumption and during the 0-6, 6-12 and 12-24 h periods after consumption. (2)-Epicatechin metabolite excretion was measured using liquid chromatography-MS. One (2)-epicatechin glucuronide and three (2)-epicatechin sulfates were detected in urine excreted after the intake of the two cocoa beverages (CC-M and CC-W). The results show that milk does not significantly affect the total amount of metabolites excreted in urine. However, differences in metabolite excretion profiles were observed; there were changes in the glucuronide and sulfate excretion rates, and the sulfation position between the period of excretion and the matrix. The matrix in which polyphenols are consumed can affect their metabolism and excretion, and this may affect their biological activity.
