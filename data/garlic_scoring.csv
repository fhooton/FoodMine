29693456,"After gas chromatography and mass spectrometry of prepared methanolic extract of Allium sativum, 40 laboratory BALB/c mice were infected intraperitoneally by injection of 1,500 viable protoscoleces. Five months after infection, the infected mice were allocated into four treatment groups, including 1- Albendazole (100 mg/kg); 2- Allium sativum methanolic extract (10 mL/L); 3- A. sativum methanolic extract (10 mL/L) + Albendazole (50 mg /kg); and 4- untreated control group. After 30 days of daily treatment, total number and weight of cysts and size of the largest cyst as well as blood serum bilirubin and liver enzymes were compared between the mice of different groups. The total number and weight of cysts and size of the largest cyst were significantly lower in treated groups A. sativum 10 mL/L + Albendazole 50 and Albendazole 100 in comparison to those of the control group (p < 0.05). The activity of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzyme and bilirubin concentration were significantly lower in the mice treated with A. sativum 10 mL/L and A. sativum 10 mL/L + Albendazole 50, when compared to the control group. In addition, bilirubin concentration revealed significant decrease in A. sativum 10 mL/L and A. sativum 10 mL/L + Albendazole 50 groups, when compared to the Albendazole group. In conclusion, administration of A. sativum 10 mL/L improved the anti-hydatidosis activity of Albendazole 50 mg /kg, due to parasitological effects similar to Albendazole 100 mg /kg but less hepatotoxic effects.",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,[],[],Allium Sativum Methanolic Extract (garlic) Improve Therapeutic Efficacy of Albendazole Against Hydatid Cyst: In Vivo Study.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29693456,2018,1.0,1.0,,,
29653182,"Meju, a cooked and fermented soy bean based food product, is used as a major ingredient in Korean traditional fermented foods such as Doenjang. We developed a novel type of Meju using single and combined extracts of Allium sativum (garlic clove), Nelumbo nucifera (lotus leaves), and Ginkgo biloba (ginkgo leaves) at 1% and 10% concentrations to improve the safety of Meju-based fermented products. Biogenic amines (BAs) in protein-rich fermented food products pose considerable toxical risks. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of adding selected plant extracts in Meju samples during fermentation. Nine BAs, including tryptamine, 2-phenylethylamine, putrescine, cadaverine, agmatine, histamine, tyramine, spermidine and spermine, were isolated from Meju samples after sample derivatization with dansyl chloride and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. As a result, all tested Meju samples with added plant extracts showed total BAs levels in the range of 20.12 ± 2.03 to 118.42 ± 10.68 mg/100 g, which were below the safety limit set by various regulatory authorities (USFDA/KFDA/EFSA). However, among all tested Meju samples, LOM10 (Meju fermented with Nelumbo nucifera at 10% concentration) showed higher levels of BAs content than others either due to batch-to-batch variability or reduced beneficial microorganisms and/or due to increase in BA forming microorganisms. Also, none of the samples showed the aflatoxin level above the detection limit. Furthermore, all the tested Meju samples improved microbial safety as confirmed by the complete absence of Salmonella species and Staphylococcus aureus.

28932845,"Garlic (A. sativum) contains a large number of small sulphur (S)-containing metabolites, which are important for its taste and smell and vary with A. sativum variety and growth conditions. This study was designed to investigate the influence of different sulphur-fertilization regimes on low molecular weight S-species by attempting the first sulphur mass balance in A. sativum roots and bulbs using HPLC-ICPMS/MS-ESI-MS/MS. Species unspecific quantification of acid soluble S-containing metabolites was achieved using HPLC-ICP-MS/MS. For identification of the compounds, high resolution ESI-MS (Orbitrap LTQ and q-TOF) was used. The plants contained up to 54 separated sulphur-containing compounds, which constitute about 80% of the total sulphur present in A. sativum. The roots and bulbs of A. sativum contained the same compounds, but not necessarily the same amounts and proportions. The S-containing metabolites in the roots reacted more sensitively to manipulations of sulphur fertilization than those compounds in the bulbs. In addition to known compounds (e.g. γ-glutamyl-S-1-propenylcysteine) we were able to identify and partially quantify 31 compounds. Three as yet undescribed S-containing compounds were also identified and quantified for the first time. Putative structures were assigned to the oxidised forms of S-1-propenylmercaptoglutathione, S-2-propenylmercaptoglutathione, S-allyl/propenyl-containing PC-2 and 2-amino-3-[(2-carboxypropyl)sulfanyl]propanoic acid. The parallel use of ICP-MS/MS as a sulphur-specific detector and ESI-MS as a molecular detector simplifies the identification and quantification of sulphur containing metabolites without species specific standards. This non-target analysis approach enables a mass balance approach and identifies the occurrence of the so far unidentified organosulphur compounds. The experiments showed that the sulphur-fertilization regime does not influence sulphur-speciation, but the concentration of some S-containing compounds in roots is dependent on sulphur fertilization.",Metallomics : integrated biometal science,"['D002851', 'D005737', 'D021241', 'D013457', 'D053719']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Garlic', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Sulphur fertilization influences the sulphur species composition in Allium sativum: sulphomics using HPLC-ICPMS/MS-ESI-MS/MS.,"['Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000379']","['methods', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28932845,2018,0.0,0.0,,,

28629219,"Glucosinolates are the most abundant secondary sulfur-containing plant metabolites in the plant family of Brassicaceae. These phytochemicals are well-known for their enzymatic degradation induced by the enzyme myrosinase, resulting in pungent odor impressions derived from their respective degradation products. However, up to now, only little attention has been paid to non-enzymatic thermal degradation and the release of additional aroma-active compounds. Thermal treatment is particularly important in the processing of Brassica vegetables, and thereby, glucosinolates as precursors can act as a natural source of odorants. Application of gas chromatography-olfactometry to the volatile fractions obtained after heat treatment of sinigrin (2-propenyl glucosinolate) in different matrices (phosphate buffer at a pH value of 5, 7, or 9, silicon oil, silica gel (7% water), sea sand, and glycerol) showed a high potential to generate aroma-active compounds, mainly revealing onion- and garlic-like odor impressions deriving from sulfur-containing odorants. A clear dependency of the formation of desired aroma-active compounds upon the respective matrix was found, indicating the need of detailed investigations to obtain knowledge for the best use of glucosinolates as a source of natural aroma compositions. For example, the distillate obtained from sinigrin heat-processed in buffer solution at pH 7 led to the identification of 17 odorants.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D001937', 'D002849', 'D003296', 'D005421', 'D005961', 'D006358', 'D009812', 'D064367', 'D014675', 'D055549']","['Brassica', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Cooking', 'Flavoring Agents', 'Glucosinolates', 'Hot Temperature', 'Odorants', 'Olfactometry', 'Vegetables', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Thermally Induced Generation of Desirable Aroma-Active Compounds from the Glucosinolate Sinigrin.,"['Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28629219,2018,0.0,0.0,,,

In the present study, we investigated the antihypertensive effects of AGE and its major constituents including S-1-propenylcysteine (S1PC) and S-allylcysteine (SAC) using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and found that S1PC is an active substance to lower blood pressure in SHR. In addition, the metabolomics approach was used to investigate the potential mechanism of the antihypertensive action of S1PC in SHR. Treatment with AGE (2g/kg body weight) or S1PC (6.5mg/kg body weight; equivalent to AGE 2g/kg body weight) significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHR after the repeated administration for 10 weeks, whereas treatment with SAC (7.9mg/kg body weight; equivalent to AGE 2g/kg body weight) did not decrease the SBP. After the treatment for 10 weeks, the plasma samples obtained from Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHR were analyzed by means of ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Multivariate statistical analysis of LC-MS data showed a clear difference in the metabolite profiles between WKY rats and SHR. The results indicated that 30 endogenous metabolites significantly contributed to the difference and 7 of 30 metabolites were changed by the S1PC treatment. Furthermore, regression analysis showed correlation between SBP and the plasma levels of betaine, tryptophan and 3 LysoPCs.

27916960,"The metabolism and excretion of flavor constituents of garlic, a common plant used in flavoring foods and attributed with several health benefits, in humans is not fully understood. Likewise, the physiologically active principles of garlic have not been fully clarified to date. It is possible that not only the parent compounds present in garlic but also its metabolites are responsible for the specific physiological properties of garlic, including its influence on the characteristic body odor signature of humans after garlic consumption. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to investigate potential garlic-derived metabolites in human urine. To this aim, 14 sets of urine samples were obtained from 12 volunteers, whereby each set comprised one sample that was collected prior to consumption of food-relevant concentrations of garlic, followed by five to eight subsequent samples after garlic consumption that covered a time interval of up to 26 h. The samples were analyzed chemo-analytically using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry (GC-MS/O), as well as sensorially by a trained human panel. The analyses revealed three different garlic-derived metabolites in urine, namely allyl methyl sulfide (AMS), allyl methyl sulfoxide (AMSO) and allyl methyl sulfone (AMSO₂), confirming our previous findings on human milk metabolite composition. The excretion rates of these metabolites into urine were strongly time-dependent with distinct inter-individual differences. These findings indicate that the volatile odorant fraction of garlic is heavily biotransformed in humans, opening up a window into substance circulation within the human body with potential wider ramifications in view of physiological effects of this aromatic plant that is appreciated by humans in their daily diet.",Metabolites,[],[],Detection of Volatile Metabolites Derived from Garlic (Allium sativum) in Human Urine.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27916960,2018,0.0,0.0,,,

A single band on native gel electrophoresis confirms the homogeneity of the purified inhibitor. The molecular weight of the purified inhibitor was found to be 12.5kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration chromatography. The garlic phytocystatin was found to be stable under broad range of pH (6-8) and temperature (30°C-60°C).

The metabolite formation from probe substrates for the CYP isoforms was examined in human liver microsomes in the presence of organosulfur compounds at 0.01-1 mM by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Allicin, a major component of garlic, inhibited CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 activity by 21-45% at 0.03 mM. In contrast, a CYP2C9-catalyzed reaction was enhanced by up to 1.9 times in the presence of allicin at 0.003-0.3 mM. SAC, SMC, and S1PC had no effect on the activities of the five isoforms, except that S1PC inhibited CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam 1'-hydroxylation by 31% at 1 mM.

The volatiles responsible for garlic breath include diallyl disulfide, allyl mercaptan, allyl methyl disulfide, and allyl methyl sulfide. After eating garlic, water (control), raw, juiced or heated apple, raw or heated lettuce, raw or juiced mint leaves, or green tea were consumed immediately. The levels of the garlic volatiles on the breath were analyzed from 1 to 60 min by selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS). Garlic was also blended with water (control), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), rosemarinic acid, quercetin or catechin, and the volatiles in the headspace analyzed from 3 to 40 min by SIFT-MS. Raw apple, raw lettuce, and mint leaves significantly decreased all of the garlic breath volatiles in vivo. The proposed mechanism is enzymatic deodorization where volatiles react with phenolic compounds. Apple juice and mint juice also had a deodorizing effect on most of the garlic volatiles but were generally not as effective as the raw food, probably because the juice had enzymatic activity but the phenolic compounds had already polymerized. Both heated apple and heated lettuce produced a significant reduction of diallyl disulfide and allyl mercaptan. The presence of phenolic compounds that react with the volatile compounds even in the absence of enzymes is the most likely mechanism.

27300762,"Black garlic is produced through thermal processing and is used as a healthy food throughout the world. Compared with fresh garlic, there are obvious changes in the color, taste, and biological functions of black garlic. To analyze and explain these changes, the contents of water-soluble sugars, fructan, and the key intermediate compounds (Heyns and Amadori) of the Maillard reaction in fresh raw garlic and black garlic were investigated, which were important to control and to evaluate the quality of black garlic. The results showed that the fructan contents in the black garlics were decreased by more than 84.6% compared with the fresh raw garlics, which translated into changes in the fructose and glucose contents. The water-soluble sugar content was drastically increased by values ranging from 187.79% to 790.96%. Therefore, the taste of the black garlic became very sweet. The sucrose content in black garlic was almost equivalent to fresh garlic. The Amadori and Heyns compounds were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS in multiple reaction monitoring mode using the different characteristic fragment ions of Heyns and Amadori compounds. The total content of the 3 main Amadori and 3 Heyns compounds in black garlic ranged from 762.53 to 280.56 μg/g, which was 40 to 100-fold higher than the values in fresh raw garlic.

It is necessary to explore novel nonthermal techniques for preventing foodborne viral contamination. In this study, aqueous extracts of six raw food materials (flower buds of clove, fenugreek seeds, garlic and onion bulbs, ginger rhizomes, and jalapeño peppers) were tested for antiviral activity against feline calicivirus (FCV) as a surrogate for human norovirus. The antiviral assay was performed using dilutions of the extracts below the maximum nontoxic concentrations of the extracts to the host cells of FCV, Crandell-Reese feline kidney (CRFK) cells. No antiviral effect was seen when the host cells were pretreated with any of the extracts. However, pretreatment of FCV with nondiluted clove and ginger extracts inactivated 6.0 and 2.7 log of the initial titer of the virus, respectively. Also, significant dosedependent inactivation of FCV was seen when host cells were treated with clove and ginger extracts at the time of infection or postinfection at concentrations equal to or lower than the maximum nontoxic concentrations. By comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, eugenol (29.5%) and R-(-)-1,2-propanediol (10.7%) were identified as the major components of clove and ginger extracts, respectively. The antiviral effect of the pure eugenol itself was tested; it showed antiviral activity similar to that of clove extract, albeit at a lower level, which indicates that some other clove extract constituents, along with eugenol, are responsible for inactivation of FCV.

Sensory evaluation revealed a clear garlic/cabbage-like odor that appeared in breast milk about 2.5 h after consumption of garlic. GC-MS/O analyses confirmed the occurrence of garlic-derived metabolites in breast milk, namely allyl methyl sulfide (AMS), allyl methyl sulfoxide (AMSO) and allyl methyl sulfone (AMSO₂). Of these, only AMS had a garlic-like odor whereas the other two metabolites were odorless. This demonstrates that the odor change in human milk is not related to a direct transfer of garlic odorants, as is currently believed, but rather derives from a single metabolite. The formation of these metabolites is not fully understood, but AMSO and AMSO₂ are most likely formed by the oxidation of AMS in the human body.

27008862,"Allicin (diallyl thiosulfinate) from garlic is a highly potent natural antimicrobial substance. It inhibits growth of a variety of microorganisms, among them antibiotic-resistant strains. However, the precise mode of action of allicin is unknown. Here, we show that growth inhibition of Escherichia coli during allicin exposure coincides with a depletion of the glutathione pool and S-allylmercapto modification of proteins, resulting in overall decreased total sulfhydryl levels. This is accompanied by the induction of the oxidative and heat stress response. We identified and quantified the allicin-induced modification S-allylmercaptocysteine for a set of cytoplasmic proteins by using a combination of label-free mass spectrometry and differential isotope-coded affinity tag labeling of reduced and oxidized thiol residues. Activity of isocitrate lyase AceA, an S-allylmercapto-modified candidate protein, is largely inhibited by allicin treatment in vivo Allicin-induced protein modifications trigger protein aggregation, which largely stabilizes RpoH and thereby induces the heat stress response. At sublethal concentrations, the heat stress response is crucial to overcome allicin stress.

26964532,"The quality of chicken meat, which is one of the most widely consumed meats in the world, has been the subject of research and studies for many years. There are several ways to improve the quality of this type of meat, including changing the concentrations of individual molecular components. Such important components of meat are inter alia, cholesterol, vitamin E, and some fatty acids such as ω-3 and ω-6. Manipulation of ingredient levels may be achieved by enriching chicken feed with elements of different types such as vegetable oils, garlic, or selenium. Thus far, various biochemical and biophysical methods have been used to study quality of different meat types, especially broiler meat. Here, the authors demonstrate the use of high-resolution time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) mass spectrometry to assess how variations in animal nutrition affect concentrations of specific lipids in the meat, such as cholesterol and vitamin E. In the presented experiment, there were four different dietary treatments. Feed for animals in the first group was supplemented with soy oil in 50%, the second group's feed was supplemented with linseed oil in 50%, a combination of these two oils in the proportion of 44%:56% was used for the third group, and in the reference group, animals were fed with beef tallow. From each group, four individuals were selected for further analysis. Positive and negative ion mass spectra were generated from the pectoralis superficialis muscle tissue of the left carcass side of each one animal. Using TOF-SIMS with a bismuth cluster ion source (Bi3 (+)), and based on characteristic peaks for cholesterol in the positive mode and vitamin E in the negative mode, the authors have illustrated the relationship of these lipids levels to the various feeding regimens. Simultaneously, the authors characterized the varying dependences on the concentrations of measured lipids in fat and muscle fibers. The cholesterol concentration in muscle fibers was the lowest in the group fed with soybean oil and the highest in reference group IV (tallow feed). In the fatty region, the highest level of cholesterol was found in the third group. The highest concentrations of vitamin E were found in the fibers of the first group and the fat region of the second group. The obtained results show that SIMS imaging is a useful approach for assessing changes in lipid concentrations in the meat tissue from animals on different diets and provides a foundation for future research.

Observation by transmission electron microscopy indicated that garlic oil could penetrate the cellular membrane of C. albicans as well as the membranes of organelles such as the mitochondria, resulting in organelle destruction and ultimately cell death. RNA sequencing analysis showed that garlic oil induced differential expression of critical genes including those involved in oxidation-reduction processes, pathogenesis, and cellular response to drugs and starvation. Moreover, the differentially expressed genes were mainly clustered in 19 KEGG pathways, representing vital cellular processes such as oxidative phosphorylation, the spliceosome, the cell cycle, and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, four upregulated proteins selected after two-dimensional fluorescence difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) analysis were identified with high probability by mass spectrometry as putative cytoplasmic adenylate kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, hexokinase, and heat shock proteins.

The strong antioxidant effect of garlic extract (GE) has also recently been claimed to prevent cancer, thrombus formation, cardiovascular disease and some age-related maladies. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism, aqueous GE was herein shown to increase the expression of longevity-related FOXO transcription factor daf-16 and extend lifespan by 20%. By employing microarray and proteomics analysis on C. elegans treated with aqueous GE, we have systematically mapped 229 genes and 46 proteins with differential expression profiles, which included many metabolic enzymes and yolky egg vitellogenins. To investigate the garlic components functionally involved in longevity, an integrated metabolo-proteomics approach was employed to identify metabolites and protein components associated with treatment of aqueous GE. Among potential lifespan-promoting substances, mannose-binding lectin and N-acetylcysteine were found to increase daf-16 expression. Our study points to the fact that the lifespan-promoting effect of aqueous GE may entail the DAF-16-mediated signaling pathway. The result also highlights the utility of metabolo-proteomics for unraveling the complexity and intricacy involved in the metabolism of natural products in vivo.

Compared to the room-temperature (+25 °C) scenario, the alliin conversion in garlic cloves decreased by (7.2 ± 1.4) times upon heating to +80 °C and by (5.9 ± 0.8) times upon cooling to -16 °C. Exposure of garlic to gentle ultrasound irradiation for 3 h accelerated the reaction by (1.2 ± 0.1) times. A 10 s microwave irradiation promoted alliin conversion by (1.6 ± 0.4) times, but longer exposure to microwave irradiation (90 s) slowed the reaction by (28.5 ± 7.5) times compared to the reference analysis. This method has been further employed to monitor the germination process of garlic.

25608858,"Natural organosulfur compounds (OSCs) from Allium sativum L. display antioxidant and chemo-sensitization properties, including the in vitro inhibition of tumor cell proliferation through the induction of apoptosis. Garlic water- and oil-soluble allyl sulfur compounds show distinct properties and the capability to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells. In the present study, we optimized a new protocol for the extraction of water-soluble compounds from garlic at low temperatures and the production of glutathionyl-OSC conjugates during the extraction. Spontaneously, Cys/GSH-mixed-disulfide conjugates are produced by in vivo metabolism of OSCs and represent active molecules able to affect cellular metabolism. Water-soluble extracts, with (GSGaWS) or without (GaWS) glutathione conjugates, were here produced and tested for their ability to release hydrogen sulfide (H2S), also in the presence of reductants and of thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase (TST) enzyme. Thus, the TST catalysis of the H2S-release from garlic OSCs and their conjugates has been investigated by molecular in vitro experiments. The antiproliferative properties of these extracts on the human T-cell lymphoma cell line, HuT 78, were observed and related to histone hyperacetylation and downregulation of GAPDH expression. Altogether, the results presented here pave the way for the production of a GSGaWS as new, slowly-releasing hydrogen sulfide extract for potential therapeutic applications.

25438250,"The antimicrobial activities of garlic and other plant alliums are primarily based on allicin, a thiosulphinate present in crushed garlic bulbs. We set out to determine if pure allicin and aqueous garlic extracts (AGE) exhibit antimicrobial properties against the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), the major bacterial phytopathogen for alliums and an intrinsically multiresistant and life-threatening human pathogen. We prepared an AGE from commercial garlic bulbs and used HPLC to quantify the amount of allicin therein using an aqueous allicin standard (AAS). Initially we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the AGE against 38 Bcc isolates; these MICs ranged from 0.5 to 3% (v/v). The antimicrobial activity of pure allicin (AAS) was confirmed by MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) assays against a smaller panel of five Bcc isolates; these included three representative strains of the most clinically important species, B. cenocepacia. Time kill assays, in the presence of ten times MIC, showed that the bactericidal activity of AGE and AAS against B. cenocepacia C6433 correlated with the concentration of allicin. We also used protein mass spectrometry analysis to begin to investigate the possible molecular mechanisms of allicin with a recombinant form of a thiol-dependent peroxiredoxin (BCP, Prx) from B. cenocepacia. This revealed that AAS and AGE modifies an essential BCP catalytic cysteine residue and suggests a role for allicin as a general electrophilic reagent that targets protein thiols. To our knowledge, we report the first evidence that allicin and allicin-containing garlic extracts possess inhibitory and bactericidal activities against the Bcc. Present therapeutic options against these life-threatening pathogens are limited; thus, allicin-containing compounds merit investigation as adjuncts to existing antibiotics.

25435245,"The present study reported on an in situ solvothermal growth method for immobilization of metal-organic framework MOF-5 on porous copper foam support for enrichment of plant volatile sulfides. The porous copper support impregnated with mother liquor of MOF-5 anchors the nucleation and growth of MOF crystallites at its surface, and its architecture of the three-dimensional channel enables accommodation of the MOF-5 crystallite seed. A continuous and well-intergrown MOF-5 layer, evidenced from scanning electron microscope imaging and X-ray diffraction, was successfully immobilized on the porous metal bar with good adhesion and high stability. Results show that the resultant MOF-5 coating was thermally stable up to 420 °C and robust enough for replicate extraction for at least 200 times. The MOF-5 bar was then applied to the headspace sorptive extraction of the volatile organic sulfur compounds in Chinese chive and garlic sprout in combination with thermal desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. It showed high extraction sensitivity and good selectivity to these plant volatile sulfides owing to the extraordinary porosity of the metal-organic framework as well as the interaction between the S-donor sites and the surface cations at the crystal edges. Several primary sulfur volatiles containing allyl methyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, diallyl sulfide, methyl allyl disulfide, and diallyl disulfide were quantified. Their limits of detection were found to be in the range of 0.2-1.7 μg/L. The organic sulfides were detected in the range of 6.0-23.8 μg/g with recoveries of 76.6-100.2% in Chinese chive and 11.4-54.6 μg/g with recoveries of 77.1-99.8% in garlic sprout.

25420111,"Aged garlic extract (AGE) is widely used as a dietary supplement, and is claimed to promote human health through anti-oxidant/anti-inflammatory activities with hypolipidemic, antiplatelet and neuroprotective effects. Prior studies of AGE have mainly focused on its organosulfur compounds, with little attention paid to its carbohydrate derivatives, such as N-α-(1-deoxy-D-fructos-1-yl)-L-arginine (FruArg). The goal of this study is to investigate actions of AGE and FruArg on antioxidative and neuroinflammatory responses in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated murine BV-2 microglial cells using a proteomic approach. Our data show that both AGE and FruArg can significantly inhibit LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in BV-2 cells. Quantitative proteomic analysis by combining two dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) with mass spectrometry revealed that expressions of 26 proteins were significantly altered upon LPS exposure, while levels of 20 and 21 proteins exhibited significant changes in response to AGE and FruArg treatments, respectively, in LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells. Notably, approximate 78% of the proteins responding to AGE and FruArg treatments are in common, suggesting that FruArg is a major active component of AGE. MULTICOM-PDCN and Ingenuity Pathway Analyses indicate that the proteins differentially affected by treatment with AGE and FruArg are involved in inflammatory responses and the Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response. Collectively, these results suggest that AGE and FruArg attenuate neuroinflammatory responses and promote resilience in LPS-activated BV-2 cells by suppressing NO production and by regulating expression of multiple protein targets associated with oxidative stress.

Autofluorescence of NAD(P)H and FAD alongside the fluorescence of the GSH-adduct in monochlorobimane-treated live organisms allowed the monitoring of redox balances before and after treatment with inhibitors, metronidazole and auranofin. H₂O₂ was emitted into the exterior of S. vortens at a rate of 2.85 pmol/min/10⁶ cells. Metronidazole and auranofin led to depletion of S. vortens intracellular NAD(P)H pools and an increase in H₂O₂ release with concomitant oxidation of GSH, respectively. Garlic-derived compounds completely inhibited O₂ consumption by S. vortens (ajoene oil), or significantly depleted the intracellular GSH pool of the organism (allyl alcohol and DADS). Hence, antioxidant defence mechanisms of S. vortens may provide novel targets for parasite chemotherapy.",Molecular and biochemical parasitology,"['D002851', 'D003545', 'D016828', 'D005978', 'D009097', 'D009247', 'D018384', 'D010100', 'D013312', 'D013447', 'D013482']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cysteine', 'Diplomonadida', 'Glutathione', 'Multienzyme Complexes', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Sulfites', 'Superoxide Dismutase']",Antioxidant defences of Spironucleus vortens: Glutathione is the major non-protein thiol.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', None, 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25101875,2015,0.0,0.0,,,

Birds were killed at day 42 and intestinal samples were collected to assess for Lactobacillus and Escherichia coli. The pectoralis profundus from chicken breast samples was obtained from 10 birds from each treatment group on day 42 and frozen at -20°C for further analyses. Fatty acid profile of breast muscles was determined using gas liquid chromatography. Feed intake and weight gain of broilers fed with GP, PW, and VM were significantly higher (p<0.05) compared to control. Feeding chicks GP, PW, and VM significantly reduced Escherichia coli count (p<0.05) while Lactobacillus spp count were significantly higher (p<0.05) in the gut when compared to control group on day 42. Supplemented diet containing pennywort increased the C18:3n-3 fatty acid composition of chickens' breast muscle.

In this study, the chemical constituents, antifungal activity, and effects of garlic oil were studied with Penicillium funiculosum as a model strain. Results showed that the minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs, v/v) were 0.125 and 0.0313 % in agar medium and broth medium, respectively, suggesting that the garlic oil had a strong antifungal activity. The main ingredients of garlic oil were identified as sulfides, mainly including disulfides (36 %), trisulfides (32 %) and monosulfides (29 %) by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC/MS), which were estimated as the dominant antifungal factors. The observation results by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) indicated that garlic oil could firstly penetrate into hyphae cells and even their organelles, and then destroy the cellular structure, finally leading to the leakage of both cytoplasm and macromolecules. Further proteomic analysis displayed garlic oil was able to induce a stimulated or weakened expression of some key proteins for physiological metabolism.

Se-garlic oil was extracted by organic solvent extraction. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to detect the content of allicin in the Se-garlic oil. Hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS) was used to detect the content of Se in the Se-garlic oil. ECV-304 cells were separated into five groups (blank, ox-LDL, and low-, medium-, and high-dose Se-garlic oil).

Flow cytometry (FCM) stained with annexin V-FITC/PI was used to detect the apoptosis of the cells from the blank, Se-garlic oil, ox-LDL, and Se-garlic oil + ox-ldl groups after 48 hours of incubation. Results. The amount of allicin in Se-garlic oil was 142.66 mg/ml, while, in Se, it was 198 mg/kg. When ox-LDL was added to low-, medium-, and high-dose Se-garlic oil, the cell viability rates of ECV-304 cells treated in the three groups were all higher, while the apoptosis rates were significantly lower than those of the ox-LDL group (P < 0.05).

Detection and quantification of protein S-nitrosylation have been challenging tasks due to instability and low abundance of the modification. Many studies have used mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods with different thiol-reactive reagents to label and identify proteins with S-nitrosylated cysteine (SNO-Cys). In this study, we developed a novel iodoTMT switch assay (ISA) using an isobaric set of thiol-reactive iodoTMTsixplex reagents to specifically detect and quantify protein S-nitrosylation. Irreversible labeling of SNO-Cys with the iodoTMTsixplex reagents enables immune-affinity detection of S-nitrosylated proteins, enrichment of iodoTMT-labeled peptides by anti-TMT resin, and importantly, unambiguous modification site-mapping and multiplex quantification by liquid chromatography-tandem MS. Additionally, we significantly improved anti-TMT peptide enrichment efficiency by competitive elution. Using ISA, we identified a set of SNO-Cys sites responding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in murine BV-2 microglial cells and revealed effects of S-allyl cysteine from garlic on LPS-induced protein S-nitrosylation in antioxidative signaling and mitochondrial metabolic pathways.

The treatments were consumed immediately following raw garlic consumption for breath measurements, or were blended with garlic prior to headspace measurements. Measurements were done using a selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometer. Chlorophyllin treatment demonstrated no deodorization in comparison to the control. Successful treatments may be due to enzymatic, polyphenolic, or acid deodorization. Enzymatic deodorization involved oxidation of polyphenolic compounds by enzymes, with the oxidized polyphenols causing deodorization. This was the probable mechanism in raw apple, parsley, spinach, and mint treatments. Polyphenolic deodorization involved deodorization by polyphenolic compounds without enzymatic activity. This probably occurred for microwaved apple, green tea, and lemon juice treatments. When pH is below 3.6, the enzyme alliinase is inactivated, which causes a reduction in volatile formation.

24267071,"The use of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emanating from human skin presents great potential for skin disease diagnosis. These compounds are emitted at very low concentrations. Thus, the sampling preparation step needs to be implemented before gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. In this work, a simple, non-invasive headspace sampling method for volatile compounds emanating from human skin is presented, using thin film as the extraction phase format. The proposed method was evaluated in terms of reproducibility, membrane size, extraction mode and storage conditions. First, the in vial sampling showed an intra- and inter-membrane RSD% less than 9.8% and 8.2%, respectively, which demonstrated that this home-made skin volatiles sampling device was highly reproducible with regard to intra-, inter-membrane sampling. The in vivo sampling was influenced not only by the skin metabolic status, but also by environmental conditions. The developed sampling set-up (or ""membrane sandwich"") was used to compare two different modes of sampling: headspace and direct sampling. Results demonstrated that headspace sampling had significantly reduced background signal intensity, indicating minimized contamination from the skin surface. In addition, membrane storage conditions both before and after sampling were fully investigated. Membranes stored in dry ice for up to 72 h after collection were tested and showed no or minimal change in volatile profiles. This novel skin volatile compounds sampling approach coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) can achieve reproducible analysis. This technique was applied to identify the biomarkers of garlic intake and alcohol ingestion. Dimethyl sulphone, allyl methyl sulfide and allyl mercaptan, as metabolites of garlic intake, were detected. In addition, alcohol released from skin was also detected using our ""membrane-sandwich"" sampling. Using the same approach, we analyzed skin VOCs from upper back, forearm and back thigh regions of the body. Our results show that different body locations share a number of common compounds (27/99).

However, information about the biological and toxicological activities of Te in plants and animals is limited. Although Te is expected to be metabolized in organisms via the same pathway as sulfur and selenium (Se), no precise metabolic pathways are known in organisms, particularly in plants. To reveal the metabolic pathway of Te in plants, garlic, a well-known Se accumulator, was chosen as the model plant. Garlic was hydroponically cultivated and exposed to sodium tellurate, and Te-containing metabolites in the water extract of garlic leaves were identified using HPLC coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) or electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS-MS). At least three Te-containing metabolites were detected using HPLC-ICP-MS, and two of them were subjected to HPLC-ESI-MS-MS for identification. The MS spectra obtained by ESI-MS-MS indicated that the metabolite was Te-methyltellurocysteine oxide (MeTeCysO). Then, MeTeCysO was chemically synthesized and its chromatographic behavior matched with that of the Te-containing metabolite in garlic. The other was assigned as cysteine S-methyltellurosulfide. These results suggest that garlic can assimilate tellurate, an inorganic Te compound, and tellurate is transformed into a Te-containing amino acid, the so-called telluroamino acid.

23765168,"Combined pollution of selenium (Se) and mercury (Hg) has been known in Wanshan district (Guizhou Province, China). A better understanding of how Se and Hg interact in plants and the phytotoxicity thereof will provide clues about how to avoid or mitigate adverse effects of Se/Hg on local agriculture. In this study, the biological activity of Se has been investigated in garlic with or without Hg exposure. Se alone can promote garlic growth at low levels (<0.1 mg L(-1)), whereas it inhibits garlic growth at high levels (>1 mg L(-1)). The promotive effect of Se in garlic can be enhanced by low Hg exposure (<0.1 mg L(-1)). When both Se and Hg are at high levels, there is a general antagonistic effect between these two elements in terms of phytotoxicity. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) data suggest that Se is mainly concentrated in garlic roots, compared to the leaves and the bulbs. Se uptake by garlic in low Se medium (<0.1 mg L(-1)) can be significantly enhanced as Hg exposure levels increase (P < 0.05), while it can be inhibited by Hg when Se exposure levels exceed 1 mg L(-1). The synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SRXRF) mapping further shows that Se is mainly concentrated in the stele of the roots, bulbs and the veins of the leaves, and Se accumulation in garlic can be reduced by Hg. The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) study indicates that Se is mainly formed in C-Se-C form in garlic. Hg can decrease the content of inorganic Se mainly in SeO3(2-) form in garlic while increasing the content of organic Se mainly in C-Se-C form (MeSeCys and its derivatives).

The distributions of selenium and mercury were examined with micro-synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (μ-SRXRF), and the mercury speciation was investigated with micro-X-ray absorption near edge structure (μ-XANES). The results show that Se at higher exposure levels (>1mg/L of SeO3(2-) or SeO4(2-)) would significantly inhibit the absorption and transportation of Hg when Hg(2+) levels are higher than 1mg/L in culture media. SeO3(2-) and SeO4(2-) were found to be equally effective in reducing Hg accumulation in garlic. The inhibition of Hg uptake by Se correlates well with the influence of Se on Hg phytotoxicity as indicated by the growth inhibition factor. Elemental imaging using μ-SRXRF also shows that Se could inhibit the accumulation and translocation of Hg in garlic. μ-XANES analysis shows that Hg is mainly present in the forms of Hg-S bonding as Hg(GSH)2 and Hg(Met)2.

The used garlic and onion oils were prepared by steam distillation and were analyzed by gas chromatography. These oils were dissolved in ethanol, methanol alcohols, and, partially, in water. The oils were tested in different concentrations; 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 %. These concentrations were applied on adult ticks by adult immersion test; on larvae by larval immersion technique and on eggs. The 20, 10, and 5 % of garlic oil dilutions in ethanol and methanol killed all adult ticks and larvae within 24 h. Similar results were obtained for 10 and 20 % garlic oil dissolved in water. The effect of 10 % aqueous solution of garlic oil on embryonated eggs was clear as its addition to these eggs led to their in ability to hatch, deformity in shape, and change in color.

Graphite oxide (GO), with rich oxygen-containing groups, was selected as the starting material to anchor ZnO on its nucleation center. After being deoxidized by hydrazine, the Zn(OH)2/GO coating was dehydrated at high temperature to give the ZnO/graphene coating. Sol-gel technology could efficiently incorporate ZnO/graphene composites into the sol-gel network and provided strong chemical bonding between sol-gel polymeric SPME coating and silica fiber surface, which enhanced the durability of the fiber and allowed more than 200 replicate extractions. Results indicated that pure ZnO coated fiber did not show adsorption selectivity toward sulfur compounds, which might because the ZnO nanoparticles were enwrapped in the sol-gel network, and the strong coordination action between Zn ion and S ion was therefore blocked. The incorporation of graphene into ZnO based sol-gel network greatly enlarged the BET surface area from 1.2 m2/g to 169.4 m2/g and further increased the adsorption sites. Combining the superior properties of extraordinary surface area of graphene and the strong coordination action of ZnO to sulfur compounds, the ZnO/graphene SPME fiber showed much higher adsorption affinity to 1-octanethiol (enrichment factor, EF, 1087) than other aliphatic compounds without sulfur-containing groups (EFs<200).

22964046,"This paper reports on the development and optimization of a modified Quick, Easy, Cheap Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) based extraction technique coupled with a clean-up dispersive-solid phase extraction (dSPE) as a new, reliable and powerful strategy to enhance the extraction efficiency of free low molecular-weight polyphenols in selected species of dietary vegetables. The process involves two simple steps. First, the homogenized samples are extracted and partitioned using an organic solvent and salt solution. Then, the supernatant is further extracted and cleaned using a dSPE technique. Final clear extracts of vegetables were concentrated under vacuum to near dryness and taken up into initial mobile phase (0.1% formic acid and 20% methanol). The separation and quantification of free low molecular weight polyphenols from the vegetable extracts was achieved by ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) equipped with a phodiode array (PDA) detection system and a Trifunctional High Strength Silica capillary analytical column (HSS T3), specially designed for polar compounds. The performance of the method was assessed by studying the selectivity, linear dynamic range, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, trueness, and matrix effects. The validation parameters of the method showed satisfactory figures of merit. Good linearity (Rvalues2>0.954; (+)-catechin in carrot samples) was achieved at the studied concentration range. Reproducibility was better than 3%. Consistent recoveries of polyphenols ranging from 78.4 to 99.9% were observed when all target vegetable samples were spiked at two concentration levels, with relative standard deviations (RSDs, n=5) lower than 2.9%. The LODs and the LOQs ranged from 0.005 μg mL(-1) (trans-resveratrol, carrot) to 0.62 μg mL(-1) (syringic acid, garlic) and from 0.016 μg mL(-1) (trans-resveratrol, carrot) to 0.87 μg mL(-1) ((+)-catechin, carrot) depending on the compound.

The prepared high polar PSP-TiO(2) hybrid coating avoided the swelling of PSP and cracking of TiO(2) coating by combining the good film-forming property of PSP with the high mechanical strength of TiO(2). The scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that no obvious swelling and damage occurred for the PSP-TiO(2) hybrid stir bar coating after 30 extraction/desorption cycles. The preparation reproducibility of PSP-TiO(2) coated stir bar, evaluated with the relative standard deviations (RSDs), was in the range of 6.7-12.6% (n=5) in one batch, and 9.9-17.6% (n=7) among different batches.

22860996,"Garlic has been used throughout history for both culinary and medicinal purpose. Allicin is a major component of crushed garlic. Although it is sensitive to heat and light and easily metabolized into various compounds such as diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, and diallyl sulfide, allicin is still a major bioactive compound of crushed garlic. The mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma is quite high and ranks among the top 10 cancer-related deaths in Taiwan. Although numerous studies have shown the cancer-preventive properties of garlic and its components, there is no study on the effect of allicin on the growth of human liver cancer cells. In this study, we focused on allicin-induced autophagic cell death in human liver cancer Hep G2 cells. Our results indicated that allicin induced p53-mediated autophagy and inhibited the viability of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Using Western blotting, we observed that allicin decreased the level of cytoplasmic p53, the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway, and the level of Bcl-2 and increased the expression of AMPK/TSC2 and Beclin-1 signaling pathways in Hep G2 cells. In addition, the colocalization of LC3-II with MitoTracker-Red (labeling mitochondria), resulting in allicin-induced degradation of mitochondria, could be observed by confocal laser microscopy. In conclusion, allicin of garlic shows great potential as a novel chemopreventive agent for the prevention of liver cancer.

These difficulties are mainly related to the low recoveries obtained using common multi-residue methods (MRMs)--a consequence of the very high interaction level with natural components in the matrix.

Best recoveries (in the range of 100-120%, with an RSD below 20%) were obtained using the Dutch mini-Luke method. Lower values (52-70%) were obtained for ethyl acetate whereas no recovery was obtained when the QuEChERS method was applied. Furthermore, tomato matrix was also included in the experiments in order to facilitate the comparability of results.

22473818,"Sulfenic acids play a prominent role in biology as key participants in cellular signaling relating to redox homeostasis, in the formation of protein-disulfide linkages, and as the central players in the fascinating organosulfur chemistry of the Allium species (e.g., garlic). Despite their relevance, direct measurements of their reaction kinetics have proven difficult owing to their high reactivity. Herein, we describe the results of hydrocarbon autoxidations inhibited by the persistent 9-triptycenesulfenic acid, which yields a second order rate constant of 3.0×10(6)  M(-1)  s(-1) for its reaction with peroxyl radicals in PhCl at 30 °C. This rate constant drops 19-fold in CH(3)CN, and is subject to a significant primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect, k(H)/k(D) = 6.1, supporting a formal H-atom transfer (HAT) mechanism. Analogous autoxidations inhibited by the Allium-derived (S)-benzyl phenylmethanethiosulfinate and a corresponding deuterium-labeled derivative unequivocally demonstrate the role of sulfenic acids in the radical-trapping antioxidant activity of thiosulfinates, through the rate-determining Cope elimination of phenylmethanesulfenic acid (k(H)/k(D) ≈ 4.5) and its subsequent formal HAT reaction with peroxyl radicals (k(H)/k(D) ≈ 3.5). The rate constant that we derived from these experiments for the reaction of phenylmethanesulfenic acid with peroxyl radicals was 2.8×10(7)  M(-1)  s(-1); a value 10-fold larger than that we measured for the reaction of 9-triptycenesulfenic acid with peroxyl radicals. We propose that whereas phenylmethanesulfenic acid can adopt the optimal syn geometry for a 5-centre proton-coupled electron-transfer reaction with a peroxyl radical, the 9-triptycenesulfenic is too sterically hindered, and undergoes the reaction instead through the less-energetically favorable anti geometry, which is reminiscent of a conventional HAT.","Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)","['D000975', 'D005737', 'D015394', 'D010084', 'D010545', 'D021241', 'D013434', 'D013441']","['Antioxidants', 'Garlic', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peroxides', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Sulfenic Acids', 'Sulfinic Acids']",The reaction of sulfenic acids with peroxyl radicals: insights into the radical-trapping antioxidant activity of plant-derived thiosulfinates.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000138']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemical synthesis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22473818,2012,,,,,

H(2)S is a known cardioprotective agent that protects the heart via antioxidant, antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and mitochondrial actions. Here, we investigated DATS as a stable donor of H(2)S during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury in vivo. We investigated endogenous H(2)S levels, infarct size, postischemic left ventricular function, mitochondrial respiration and coupling, endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) activation, and nuclear E2-related factor (Nrf2) translocation after DATS treatment. Mice were anesthetized and subjected to a surgical model of MI/R injury with and without DATS treatment (200 μg/kg). Both circulating and myocardial H(2)S levels were determined using chemiluminescent gas chromatography. Infarct size was measured after 45 min of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. Troponin I release was measured at 2, 4, and 24 h after reperfusion. Cardiac function was measured at baseline and 72 h after reperfusion by echocardiography. Cardiac mitochondria were isolated after MI/R, and mitochondrial respiration was investigated. NO metabolites, eNOS phosphorylation, and Nrf2 translocation were determined 30 min and 2 h after DATS administration. Myocardial H(2)S levels markedly decreased after I/R injury but were rescued by DATS treatment (P < 0.05). DATS administration significantly reduced infarct size per area at risk and per left ventricular area compared with control (P < 0.001) as well as circulating troponin I levels at 4 and 24 h (P < 0.05). Myocardial contractile function was significantly better in DATS-treated hearts compared with vehicle treatment (P < 0.05) 72 h after reperfusion. DATS reduced mitochondrial respiration in a concentration-dependent manner and significantly improved mitochondrial coupling after reperfusion (P < 0.01). DATS activated eNOS (P < 0.05) and increased NO metabolites (P < 0.05). DATS did not appear to significantly induce the Nrf2 pathway.

A systematic approach to Allium cryopreservation included: 1. revealing the most critical factors that affected regeneration after cryostorage; 2. understanding the mechanisms of cryoprotection by analyzing the thermal behavior of explants and cryoprotectant solutions using DSC and influx/efflux of cryoprotectants using HPLC; 3. assessing genetic stability of regenerants; and   4. revealing the efficiency of cryotherapy.

22284504,"In recent years, the release of information about the preventative and curative properties of garlic on different diseases and their benefits to human health has led to an increase in the consumption of garlic. To meet the requirements of international markets and reach competitiveness and profitability, farmers seek to extend the offer period of fresh garlic by increasing post-harvest life. As a result, the use of maleic hydrazide (1,2-dihydropyridazine-3,6-dione) [MH], a plant growth regulator, has been widespread in various garlic growing regions of the world. The present work was undertaken to develop and validate a new analytical procedure based on MH extraction from garlic previously frozen by liquid nitrogen and submitted to low temperature clean-up. The applicability of the method by analysis of garlic samples from a commercial plantation was also demonstrated. The influence of certain factors on the performance of the analytical methodology were studied and optimized. The approach is an efficient extraction, clean-up and determination alternative for MH residue-quantification due to its specificity and sensitivity. The use of liquid nitrogen during the sample preparation prevents the degradation of the analyte due to oxidation reactions, a major limiting factor. Moreover, the method provides good linearity (r(2): 0.999), good intermediate precision (coefficient of variation (CV): 8.39%), and extracts were not affected by the matrix effect. Under optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) (0.33 mg kg(-1)) was well below the maximum residue level (MRL) set internationally for garlic (15 mg kg(-1)), with excellent rates of recovery (over 95%), good repeatability and acceptable accuracy (CV averaged 5.74%), since garlic is a complex matrix. The analytical performance of the methodology presented was compared with other techniques already reported, with highly satisfactory results, lower LOD and higher recoveries rates. In addition, the extraction process is simple, not expensive, easily executable and requires lower volumes of organic solvent. The proposed methodology removes the need of extensive typical laboratory extraction procedures, reducing the amount of time needed for pesticide analysis and increasing sample throughput. Adopting this method gives food safety laboratories the potential to increase cost savings by a suitable technique in routine testing to determine MH residues in garlic.",Talanta,"['D002849', 'D002851', 'D003080', 'D005504', 'D005737', 'D008300', 'D000432', 'D009584', 'D010573', 'D010937', 'D015203', 'D012680', 'D052616', 'D012997']","['Chromatography, Gas', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cold Temperature', 'Food Analysis', 'Garlic', 'Maleic Hydrazide', 'Methanol', 'Nitrogen', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Plant Growth Regulators', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Solvents']",Determination of maleic hydrazide residues in garlic bulbs by HPLC.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22284504,2012,0.0,0.0,,pesti.

The unknown pink-red pigments were generated and separated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and a diode array detector (DAD) in the range of 200 to 700 nm. To generate pink-red pigments, we developed several reaction systems using garlic alliinase, purified 1-propenyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide (1-PeCSO), onion thiosulfinate, natural onion juice, and 21 free amino acids. The compound 1-PeCSO was a key compound associated with pinking in the presence of both the alliinase and amino acids. Numerous naturally occurring pink-red pigments were detected and separated from pink onion juice using the HPLC-DAD system at 515 nm. Most free amino acids, with the exceptions of histidine, serine, and cysteine, formed various pink-red pigments when reacted with onion thiosulfinate. This observation indicated that onion pinking is caused not by a single pigment, but by many. Furthermore, more than one color compound could be produced from a single amino acid; this explains, in part, why there were many pink-red compound peaks in the chromatogram of discolored natural onion juice. We presumed that the complexity of the pink-red pigments was due to the involvement of more than 21 natural amino acids as well as several derivatives of the color products produced from each amino acid. We observed that the pinking process in onion juice is very similar to that of the greening process in crushed garlic, emphasizing that both thiosulfinate from flavor precursors and free amino acids are absolutely required for the discoloration.",Journal of food science,"['D000596', 'D013437', 'D002851', 'D003545', 'D005737', 'D019697', 'D010860', 'D010940', 'D018517', 'D013053', 'D013441', 'D013454']","['Amino Acids', 'Carbon-Sulfur Lyases', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cysteine', 'Garlic', 'Onions', 'Pigments, Biological', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plant Roots', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Sulfinic Acids', 'Sulfoxides']",Identification of candidate amino acids involved in the formation of pink-red pigments in onion (Allium cepa L.) juice and separation by HPLC.,"['Q000737', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000031', 'Q000201', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'metabolism', None, 'analogs & derivatives', 'enzymology', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21535486,2011,0.0,0.0,,pigmentation,

ME has a complex and not fully understood nature. ME is also highly variable from sample to sample making it difficult to compensate for. In this work it was studied whether the background ion signals in scanned mass spectra of the LC effluent at the retention time of the analyte offer some insight into the presence and extent of matrix effect. Matrix effects for six pesticides - thiabendazole, carbendazime, methomyl, aldicarb, imazalil and methiocarb - in garlic and onion samples used in the study varied from 1% (suppression 99%) to 127% (enhancement 27%) depending on the pesticide and sample. Also standards in solvent and solvent blanks were included in the study. The ions most strongly varying from sample to sample - and therefore best describing the changes in sample composition and ME - were selected for quantification according to principal component analysis (PCA) for all six pesticides under study. These ions were used to account for ME via partial least-squares (PLS) regression. The calibration set was constructed from 19 samples and standards and the obtained calibration function was validated with seven samples and standards.

20730643,"A rapid, simple and sensitive multi-residue method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification and confirmation of 69 pesticides in fruit and vegetables using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The samples were extracted following the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe method known as QuEChERS. Mass spectrometric conditions were individually optimised for each analyte in order to achieve maximum sensitivity in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Using the developed chromatographic conditions, 69 pesticides can be separated in less than 17 min. Two selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays were used for each pesticide to obtain simultaneous quantification and identification in one run. With this method in SRM mode, more than 150 pesticides can be analysed and quantified, but their confirmation is not possible in all cases according to the European regulations on pesticide residues. Nine common representative matrices (zucchini, melon, cucumber, watermelon, tomato, garlic, eggplant, lettuce and pepper) were selected to investigate the effect of different matrices on recovery and precision. Mean recoveries ranged from 70% to 120%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 20% for all the pesticides. The proposed method was applied to the analysis of more than 2000 vegetable samples from the extensive greenhouse cultivation in the province of Almeria, Spain, during one year. The methodology combines the advantages of both QuEChERS and LC-MS/MS producing a very rapid, sensitive, accurate and reliable procedure that can be applied in routine analytical laboratories. The method was validated and accredited according to UNE-EN-ISO/IEC 17025:2005 international standard (accreditation number 278/LE1027).","Food additives & contaminants.

Fat-free and whole milk significantly reduced the head-, mouth-, and nose-space concentrations of all volatiles. Water was the major component in milk responsible for the deodorization of volatiles. Due to its higher fat content, whole milk was more effective than fat-free milk in the deodorization of the more hydrophobic volatiles diallyl disulfide and allyl methyl disulfide. Milk was more effective than water and 10% sodium caseinate in the deodorization of allyl methyl sulfide, a persistent garlic odor, in the mouth after garlic ingestion. Addition of milk to garlic before ingestion had a higher deodorizing effect on the volatiles in the mouth than drinking milk after consuming garlic.

D. citri generally rely on olfaction and vision for detection of host cues. Plant volatiles from Allium spp. (Alliaceae) are known to repel several arthropod species. We examined the effect of garlic chive (A. tuberosum Rottl.) and wild onion (A. canadense L.) volatiles on D. citri behaviour in a two-port divided T-olfactometer. Citrus leaf volatiles attracted significantly more D. citri adults than clean air. Volatiles from crushed garlic chive leaves, garlic chive essential oil, garlic chive plants, wild onion plants and crushed wild onion leaves all repelled D. citri adults when compared with clean air, with the first two being significantly more repellent than the others. However, when tested with citrus volatiles, only crushed garlic chive leaves and garlic chive essential oil were repellent, and crushed wild onions leaves were not. Analysis of the headspace components of crushed garlic chive leaves and garlic chive essential oil by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that monosulfides, disulfides and trisulfides were the primary sulfur volatiles present. In general, trisulfides (dimethyl trisulfide) inhibited the response of D. citri to citrus volatiles more than disulfides (dimethyl disulfide, allyl methyl disulfide, allyl disulfide). Monosulfides did not affect the behaviour of D. citri adults. A blend of dimethyl trisulfide and dimethyl disulfide in 1:1 ratio showed an additive effect on inhibition of D. citri response to citrus volatiles. The plant volatiles from Allium spp. did not affect the behaviour of the D. citri ecto-parasitoid Tamarixia radiata (Waterston).

20553188,"Recent studies have shown that deoxygenated human red blood cells (RBCs) converted garlic-derived polysulfides into hydrogen sulfide, which in turn produced vasorelaxation in aortic ring preparations. The vasoactivity was proposed to occur via glucose- and thiol-dependent acellular reactions. In the present study, we investigated the interaction of garlic extracts with human deoxygenated RBCs and its effect on intracellular hemoglobin molecules. The results showed that garlic extract covalently modified intraerythrocytic deoxygenated hemoglobin. The modification identified consisted of an addition of 71 atomic mass units, suggesting allylation of the cysteine residues. Consistently, purified human deoxyhemoglobin reacted with chemically pure diallyl disulfide, showing the same modification as garlic extracts. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that garlic extract and diallyl disulfide modified hemoglobin's beta-chain at cysteine-93 (beta-93C) or cysteine-112 (beta-112C). These results indicate that garlic-derived organic disulfides as well as pure diallyl disulfide must permeate the RBC membrane and modified deoxyhemoglobin at beta-93C or beta-112C.

20100526,"Over expression of lectin genes in E. coli often gives inclusion bodies that are solubilised to characterize lectins. We made N-terminal fusion of the Allium sativum leaf agglutinin (ASAL) with SUMO (small ubiquitin related modifier) peptide. The SUMO peptide allowed expression of the recombinant lectin in E. coli, predominantly in soluble form. The soluble fusion protein could be purified by immobilized metal affinity column (IMAC), followed by size exclusion chromatography. The SUMO protease failed to cleave the SUMO peptide from ASAL. This may be due to steric hindrance caused by the homodimer structure of the chimeric ASAL. Some properties like dimerization, haemagglutination and insecticidal properties of the recombinant SUMO-ASAL fusion protein were comparable to the plant derived native lectin. However, glycan array analysis revealed that the carbohydrate binding specificity of the recombinant SUMO-ASAL was altered. Further, the fusion protein was not toxic to E. coli (native ASAL exhibited toxicity). The recombinant lectin was more thermo-labile as compared to the native lectin. Three important findings of this study are: (1) sugar specificity of ASAL can be altered by amino-terminal fusion; (2) anti-E. coli activity of ASAL can be eliminated by N-terminal SUMO fusion and (3) SUMO-ASAL may be a preferred candidate insecticidal protein for the development of transgenic plants.",Journal of biotechnology,"['D000371', 'D000818', 'D003546', 'D018744', 'D052978', 'D005737', 'D006863', 'D007814', 'D037241', 'D046228', 'D018515', 'D010940', 'D011134', 'D011485', 'D055503', 'D055550', 'D011993', 'D025842', 'D018411', 'D013696']","['Agglutination', 'Animals', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'DNA, Plant', 'Disk Diffusion Antimicrobial Tests', 'Garlic', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Larva', 'Mannose-Binding Lectins', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plant Proteins', 'Polysaccharides', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Stability', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Spodoptera', 'Temperature']",SUMO fusion facilitates expression and purification of garlic leaf lectin but modifies some of its properties.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000302', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000096', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000096', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000235', 'Q000187', None]","[None, None, 'metabolism', 'isolation & purification', None, 'chemistry', None, 'drug effects', 'biosynthesis', None, 'chemistry', 'biosynthesis', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'genetics', 'drug effects', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20100526,2010,0.0,0.0,,,

Dietary garlic and onion have been recently observed to possess anti-lithogenic potential in experimental mice. In this investigation, the role of biliary proteins from rats fed lithogenic diet or garlic/onion-containing diet in the formation of cholesterol gallstones in model bile was studied. Cholesterol nucleation time of the bile from lithogenic diet group was prolonged when mixed with bile from garlic or onion groups. High molecular weight proteins of bile from garlic and onion groups delayed cholesterol crystal growth in model bile. Low molecular weight (LMW) proteins from the bile of lithogenic diet group promoted cholesterol crystal growth in model bile, while LMW protein fraction isolated from the bile of garlic and onion groups delayed the same. Biliary LMW protein fraction was subjected to affinity chromatography using Con-A and the lectin-bound and unbound fractions were studied for their influence on cholesterol nucleation time in model bile. Major portion of biliary LMW proteins in lithogenic diet group was bound to Con-A, and this protein fraction promoted cholesterol nucleation time and increased cholesterol crystal growth rate, whereas Con-A unbound fraction delayed the onset of cholesterol crystallization. Biliary protein from garlic/onion group delayed the crystallization and interfered with pronucleating activity of Con-A bound protein fraction.

Although some immunomodulatory proteins from garlic have been described, their identities are still unknown. The present study was envisaged to isolate immunomodulatory proteins from raw garlic, and examine their effects on certain cells of the immune system (lymphocytes, mast cells, and basophils) in relation to mitogenicity and hypersensitivity. Three protein components of approximately 13 kD (QR-1, QR-2, and QR-3 in the ratio 7:28:1) were separated by Q-Sepharose chromatography of 30 kD ultrafiltrate of raw garlic extract. All the 3 proteins exhibited mitogenic activity towards human peripheral blood lymphocytes, murine splenocytes and thymocytes. The mitogenicity of QR-2 was the highest among the three immunomodulatory proteins. QR-1 and QR-2 displayed hemagglutination and mannose-binding activities; QR-3 showed only mannose-binding activity. Immunoreactivity of rabbit anti-QR-1 and anti-QR-2 polyclonal antisera showed specificity for their respective antigens as well as mutual cross-reactivity; QR-3 was better recognized by anti-QR-2 (82%) than by anti-QR-1 (55%). QR-2 induced a 2-fold higher histamine release in vitro from leukocytes of atopic subjects compared to that of non-atopic subjects. In all functional studies, QR-2 was more potent compared to QR-1.

Therefore, active compounds inhibiting platelet activation were isolated from garlic extract using a P-selectin expression suppressing activity-guided fractionation technique. Garlic cloves were extracted with methanol, sequentially partitioned using ethyl acetate, and n-butanol. The ethyl acetate portion was fractionated using silica gel chromatography. The fraction with highest P-selectin expression suppressing activity was further purified using HPLC, and the compounds in the fraction were analyzed using MS, MS/MS, and NMR spectroscopic methods. Using NMR spectroscopy, the compound with highest suppressing activity was confirmed as N-feruloyltyramine. At the concentration of 0.05 microM, N-feruloyltyramine was able to suppress P-selectin expression on platelets by 31% (P < 0.016). Since COX enzymes are deeply involved in the regulation of P-selectin expression on platelets, potential effects of N-feruloyltyramine on COX enzymes were investigated. As expected at the concentration of 0.05 microM, N-feruloyltyramine was found to be a very potent compound able to inhibit COX-I and -II enzymes by 43% (P < 0.012) and 33% (P < 0.014), respectively.

There have been many reports on the antibacterial properties of allicin, but no quantitative comparison of antibacterial activities between freshly prepared garlic extract and clinically useful antibiotics has been performed. To verify the substantial antibacterial effect of aqueous garlic extract, we compared it with those of allicin and several clinically useful antibiotics using two representative bacteria commonly found in the human environment, Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli. The garlic extract had more potent anti-staphylococcal activity than an equal amount of allicin. In terms of antibiotic potency against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, authentic allicin had roughly 1-2% of the potency of streptomycin (vs. S. aureus), 8% of that of vancomycin (vs. S. aureus), and only 0.2% of that of colistin (vs. E. coli). The antibacterial activity of allicin was completely abolished by cysteine, glutathione and coenzyme A, but not by non-SH-compounds. The oxygen in the structure (-S(=O)-S-) of allicin therefore functions to liberate the S-allyl moiety, which might be an offensive tool against bacteria.","Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry","['D000900', 'D002851', 'D005737', 'D006090', 'D006094', 'D013058', 'D008826', 'D010936', 'D013438', 'D013441']","['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Garlic', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Plant Extracts', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds', 'Sulfinic Acids']",Antibacterial potential of garlic-derived allicin and its cancellation by sulfhydryl compounds.,"['Q000037', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000037']","['antagonists & inhibitors', None, 'chemistry', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, None, 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'antagonists & inhibitors']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19734685,2009,1.0,1.0,,,
19733738,"Liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry--LC/ESI/MS--a primary tool for analysis of low volatility compounds in difficult matrices--suffers from the matrix effects in the ESI ionization. It is well known that matrix effects can be reduced by sample dilution. However, the efficiency of simple sample dilution is often limited, in particular by the limit of detection of the method, and can strongly vary from sample to sample. In this study matrix effect is investigated as the function of dilution. It is demonstrated that in some cases dilution can eliminate matrix effect, but often it is just reduced. Based on these findings we propose a new quantitation method based on consecutive dilutions of the sample and extrapolation of the analyte content to the infinite dilution, i.e. to matrix-free solution. The method was validated for LC/ESI/MS analysis of five pesticides (methomyl, thiabendazole, aldicarb, imazalil, methiocarb) in five matrices (tomato, cucumber, apple, rye and garlic) at two concentration levels (0.5 and 5.0 mg kg(-1)). Agreement between the analyzed and spiked concentrations was found for all samples. It was demonstrated that in terms of accuracy of the obtained results the proposed extrapolative dilution approach works distinctly better than simple sample dilution. The main use of this approach is envisaged for (a) method development/validation to determine the extent of matrix effects and the ways of overcoming them and (b) as a second step of analysis in the case of samples having analyte contents near the maximum residue limits (MRL).",Analytica chimica acta,[],[],Combating matrix effects in LC/ESI/MS: the extrapolative dilution approach.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19733738,2009,0.0,0.0,,,

Optimization of the simultaneous extraction of these toxins and the sample pretreatment procedure, as well as method validation were performed on maca (Lepidium meyenii) food supplements. The results indicated that the solvent mixture ethyl acetate/formic acid (95:5, v/v) was the best compromise for the extraction of the analytes from food supplements. Liquid-liquid partition with n-hexane was applied as partial clean-up step to remove excess of co-extracted non-polar components. Further clean-up was performed on Oasis HLB cartridges. Samples were analysed using an Acquity UPLC system coupled to a Micromass Quattro Micro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray interface operated in the positive-ion mode. Limits of detection and quantification were in the range of 0.3-30 ng g(-1) and 1-100 ng g(-1), respectively. Recovery yields were above 60% for most of the analytes, except for nivalenol, sterigmatocystine and the fumonisins. The method showed good precision and trueness. Analysis of different food supplements such as soy (Glycine max) isoflavones, St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), garlic (Allium sativum), Ginkgo biloba, and black radish (Raphanus niger) demonstrated the general applicability of the method. Due to different matrix effects observed in different food supplement samples, the standard addition approach was applied to perform correct quantitative analysis.

N-Nitrosoproline (NPRO) excretion has been used as an index for endogenous nitrosation. In vitro and animal studies have reported that compounds in garlic may suppress nitrosation and inhibit carcinogenesis. We present a new method for extraction and sensitive detection of both NPRO and N-acetyl-S-allylcysteine from urine. The latter is a metabolite of S-allylcysteine, which is found in garlic. Urine was acidified and the organic acids were extracted by reversed-phase extraction (RP-SPE) and use of a polymeric weak anion exchange (WAX-SPE) resin. NPRO was quantified by isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using [13C5]NPRO and N-nitrosopipecolinic acid (NPIC) as internal standards. This method was used to analyze urine samples from a study that was designed to test whether garlic supplementation inhibits NPRO synthesis. Using this method, 2.4 to 46.0 ng NPRO/ml urine was detected. The method is straightforward and reliable, and it can be performed with readily available GC-MS instruments. N-Acetyl-S-allylcysteine was quantified in the same fraction and detectable at levels of 4.1 to 176.4 ng/ml urine. The results suggest that 3 to 5 g of garlic supplements inhibited NPRO synthesis to an extent similar to a 0.5-g dose of ascorbic acid or a commercial supplement of aged garlic extract.

19550292,"Garlic is generally used as a therapeutic reagent against various diseases, and numerous studies have indicated that garlic and its derivatives can reduce the risk of various types of human cancer. Diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a major member of garlic derivatives, could inhibit the cell proliferation by triggering either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines as shown in many studies. However, whether DATS has the same effect on human osteosarcoma cells remains unknown. In this study, we have attempted to analyze the effects of DATS on cell proliferation, cell cycle, induction of apoptosis, global protein expression pattern in a human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 cells, and the potential molecular mechanisms of the action of DATS. Saos-2 cells, a human osteosarcoma cell line, were treated with or without 25, 50, and 100 micromol/l DATS for various time intervals. The cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis were examined in this study. Then, after treatment with or without 50 micromol/l DATS for 48 h, protein add pattern in Saos-2 cells were systematically studied using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. DATS could inhibit the proliferation of Saos-2 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Moreover, the percentage of apoptotic cell and cell arrest in G0/G1 phase was also dose-dependent and time-dependent upon DATS treatment. A total of 27 unique proteins in Saos-2 cells, including 18 downregulated proteins and nine upregulated proteins, were detected with significant changes in their expression levels corresponding to DATS administration. Interestingly, almost half of these proteins (13 of 27) are related to either the cell cycle or apoptosis. DATS has the ability to suppress cell proliferation of Saos-2 cells by blocking cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis in a dose and time-dependent manner. The proteomic results presented, therefore, provide additional support to the hypothesis that DATS is a strong inducer of apoptosis in tumor cells.

Increasing attention has focused on the biological functions and health benefits of garlic as a potentially major dietary component. Chronic garlic administration has been shown to enhance memory function. Evidence also shows that garlic administration in rats affects brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) levels. 5-HT, a neurotransmitter involved in a number of physiological functions, is also known to enhance cognitive performance. The present study was designed to investigate the probable neurochemical mechanism responsible for the enhancement of memory following garlic administration. Sixteen adult locally bred male albino Wistar rats were divided into control (n = 8) and test (n = 8) groups. The test group was orally administered 250 mg/kg fresh garlic homogenate (FGH), while control animals received an equal amount of water daily for 21 days. Estimation of plasma free and total tryptophan (TRP) and whole brain TRP, 5-HT, and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. For assessment of memory, a step-through passive avoidance paradigm (electric shock avoidance) was used. The results showed that the levels of plasma free TRP significantly increased (P < .01) and plasma total TRP significantly decreased (P < .01) in garlic-treated rats. Brain TRP, 5-HT, and 5-HIAA levels were also significantly increased following garlic administration. A significant improvement in memory function was exhibited by garlic-treated rats in the passive avoidance test. Increased brain 5-HT levels were associated with improved cognitive performance.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is an enzyme widely distributed in mammals and is inducible preferentially by IFN-gamma. IDO degrades the essential amino acid tryptophan to form N-formyl kynurenine. In the present in vitro study, the modulatory effect of 14kDa molecule isolated from garlic on IDO induction was tested. Cultures of mononuclear cells were exposed to 14kDa garlic fraction. Then, their proliferation responses and IDO metabolites were measured. A significant down-regulatory effect of garlic on IDO activity was found and also the proliferation responses of mononuclear cells increased. If these results are verified in vivo, an explanation will be provided on how garlic may interfere in IDO induction, which paves the way for elucidating its specific therapeutic effect in preventing tumor progress.","Iranian journal of allergy, asthma, and immunology","['D000818', 'D049109', 'D002470', 'D002851', 'D005737', 'D050503', 'D007737', 'D007963', 'D051379', 'D008807', 'D010084', 'D010936', 'D011506', 'D014364']","['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Garlic', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase', 'Kynurenine', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Plant Extracts', 'Proteins', 'Tryptophan']","The 14kDa protein molecule isolated from garlic suppresses indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase metabolites in mononuclear cells in vitro.","[None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000037', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000302', 'Q000302', 'Q000378']","[None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, None, 'antagonists & inhibitors', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'drug effects', 'isolation & purification', 'isolation & purification', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19052349,2009,0.0,0.0,,,

However, there are some data showing a rather more stable nature of allicin. We determined here the thermostability of allicin by a systematic analyses employing chemical quantification and an antibacterial activity assay. Allicin in an aqueous extract of garlic was degraded stoichiometrically in proportion to the temperature; we estimated the half-life of allicin to be about a year at 4 degrees C (from 1.8 mg/ml to 0.9 mg/ml) and 32 d at 15 degrees C, but only 1 d at 37 degrees C (from 2.0 mg/ml to 1.0 mg/ml). The half-life values for antibacterial activity showed a similar trend in results: 63 d or more at 4 degrees C for both antibacterial activities, 14 d for anti-staphylococcal activity, and 26 d for anti-escherichia activity at 15 degrees C, but only 1.2 d and 1.9 d for the respective activities at 37 degrees C. Such antibacterial activities were attributable to the major allicin, allyl 2-propenylthiosulfinate.

18624452,"Potentially toxic acrylamide is largely derived from heat-induced reactions between the amino group of the free amino acid asparagine and carbonyl groups of glucose and fructose in cereals, potatoes, and other plant-derived foods. This overview surveys and consolidates the following dietary aspects of acrylamide: distribution in food originating from different sources; consumption by diverse populations; reduction of the acrylamide content in the diet; and suppression of adverse effects in vivo. Methods to reduce adverse effects of dietary acrylamide include (a) selecting potato, cereal, and other plant varieties for dietary use that contain low levels of the acrylamide precursors, namely, asparagine and glucose; (b) removing precursors before processing; (c) using the enzyme asparaginase to hydrolyze asparagine to aspartic acid; (d) selecting processing conditions (pH, temperature, time, processing and storage atmosphere) that minimize acrylamide formation; (e) adding food ingredients (acidulants, amino acids, antioxidants, nonreducing carbohydrates, chitosan, garlic compounds, protein hydrolysates, proteins, metal salts) that have been reported to prevent acrylamide formation; (f) removing/trapping acrylamide after it is formed with the aid of chromatography, evaporation, polymerization, or reaction with other food ingredients; and (g) reducing in vivo toxicity. Research needs are suggested that may further facilitate reducing the acrylamide burden of the diet. Researchers are challenged to (a) apply the available methods and to minimize the acrylamide content of the diet without adversely affecting the nutritional quality, safety, and sensory attributes, including color and flavor, while maintaining consumer acceptance; and (b) educate commercial and home food processors and the public about available approaches to mitigating undesirable effects of dietary acrylamide.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D020106', 'D000293', 'D000328', 'D000368', 'D000369', 'D001215', 'D001216', 'D002648', 'D002675', 'D004032', 'D002523', 'D005260', 'D005504', 'D005511', 'D005947', 'D006358', 'D006801', 'D007223', 'D008297', 'D008875', 'D011198']","['Acrylamide', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asparaginase', 'Asparagine', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diet', 'Edible Grain', 'Female', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Handling', 'Glucose', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Solanum tuberosum']",Review of methods for the reduction of dietary content and toxicity of acrylamide.,"['Q000008', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737']","['administration & dosage', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'methods', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18624452,2008,0.0,0.0,,relevant just not garlic,
18616471,"Sodium 2-propenyl thiosulfate, a water-soluble organo-sulfane sulfur compound isolated from garlic, induces apoptosis in a number of cancer cells. The molecular mechanism of action of sodium 2-propenyl thiosulfate has not been completely clarified. In this work we investigated, by in vivo and in vitro experiments, the effects of this compound on the expression and activity of rhodanese. Rhodanese is a protein belonging to a family of enzymes widely present in all phyla and reputed to play a number of distinct biological roles, such as cyanide detoxification, regeneration of iron-sulfur clusters and metabolism of sulfur sulfane compounds. The cytotoxic effects of sodium 2-propenyl thiosulfate on HuT 78 cells were evaluated by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation and by monitoring the progressive formation of mobile lipids by NMR spectroscopy. Sodium 2-propenyl thiosulfate was also found to induce inhibition of the sulfurtransferase activity in tumor cells. Interestingly, in vitro experiments using fluorescence spectroscopy, kinetic studies and MS analysis showed that sodium 2-propenyl thiosulfate was able to bind the sulfur-free form of the rhodanese, inhibiting its thiosulfate:cyanide-sulfurtransferase activity by thiolation of the catalytic cysteine. The activity of the enzyme was restored by thioredoxin in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. Our results suggest an important involvement of the essential thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system in cancer cell cytotoxicity by organo-sulfane sulfur compounds and highlight the correlation between apoptosis induced by these compounds and the damage to the mitochondrial enzymes involved in the repair of the Fe-S cluster and in the detoxification system.",The FEBS journal,"['D000498', 'D017209', 'D002384', 'D002453', 'D002460', 'D049109', 'D006868', 'D008055', 'D009682', 'D013050', 'D013463', 'D013879', 'D013884']","['Allyl Compounds', 'Apoptosis', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Hydrolysis', 'Lipids', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Sulfuric Acid Esters', 'Thioredoxins', 'Thiosulfate Sulfurtransferase']",Rhodanese-thioredoxin system and allyl sulfur compounds.,"['Q000494', 'Q000187', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000096', None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","['pharmacology', 'drug effects', None, None, None, None, None, 'biosynthesis', None, None, 'pharmacology', 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18616471,2008,0.0,0.0,,,

The composition of the plasticizers in the gaskets was analysed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Epoxidized soybean oil (ESBO) and phthalates were determined in the homogenized food samples. ESBO was the principal plasticizer in five of the gaskets; in 14 it was phthalates. ESBO was found in seven of the food samples at concentrations from 6 to 100 mg kg(-1). The highest levels (91-100 mg kg(-1)) were in oily foods such as garlic, chilli or olives in oil. Phthalates, i.e. di-iso-decylphthalate (DIDP) and di-iso-nonylphthalates (DINP), were found in seven samples at 6-173 mg kg(-1). The highest concentrations (99-173 mg kg(-1)) were in products of garlic and tomatoes in oil and in fatty food products such as sauce béarnaise and peanut butter. For five of the samples the overall migration from unused lids to the official fatty food simulant olive oil was determined and compared with the legal limit of 60 mg kg(-1). The results ranged from 76 to 519 mg kg(-1) and as a consequence the products were withdrawn from the market.","Food additives & contaminants.

The (77)Se-enriched gamma-glutamyl-SeMC spike was produced in-house by collecting the fraction at the retention time of the gamma-glutamyl-SeMC peak from a chromatographed aqueous extract of (77)Se-enriched yeast, pooling the collected fractions and freeze-drying the homogenate. The Se content of this spike was characterised using reverse isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) and the isotopic composition of this spike was checked prior to quantification of the natural abundance dipeptide species in garlic using speciated IDA. The extraction of the gamma-glutamyl-SeMC species in water was performed in a sonication bath for 2 h after adding an appropriate quantity of (77)Se-enriched gamma-glutamyl-SeMC to 50 mg of garlic to give optimal (78)Se/(77)Se and (82)Se/(77)Se ratios of 1.5 and 0.6, respectively. The effect of ultrasonic nebulisation, in comparison with the loading of the ICP with carbon (through the addition of methane gas on-line), on the detection of Se associated with gamma-glutamyl-SeMC using collision/reaction cell ICP-MS with hydrogen as collision gas was investigated. Sensitivity enhancements of approximately fourfold and twofold were achieved using USN and methane mixed plasma, respectively, in comparison with conventional nebulisation and conventional Ar ICP-MS. However, an approximately twofold improvement in the detection limit was achieved using both approaches (42 ng kg(-1) for (78)Se using peak height measurements).

17951430,"The consumption of garlic is inversely correlated with the progression of cardiovascular disease, although the responsible mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that human RBCs convert garlic-derived organic polysulfides into hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), an endogenous cardioprotective vascular cell signaling molecule. This H(2)S production, measured in real time by a novel polarographic H(2)S sensor, is supported by glucose-maintained cytosolic glutathione levels and is to a large extent reliant on reduced thiols in or on the RBC membrane. H(2)S production from organic polysulfides is facilitated by allyl substituents and by increasing numbers of tethering sulfur atoms. Allyl-substituted polysulfides undergo nucleophilic substitution at the alpha carbon of the allyl substituent, thereby forming a hydropolysulfide (RS(n)H), a key intermediate during the formation of H(2)S. Organic polysulfides (R-S(n)-R'; n > 2) also undergo nucleophilic substitution at a sulfur atom, yielding RS(n)H and H(2)S. Intact aorta rings, under physiologically relevant oxygen levels, also metabolize garlic-derived organic polysulfides to liberate H(2)S. The vasoactivity of garlic compounds is synchronous with H(2)S production, and their potency to mediate relaxation increases with H(2)S yield, strongly supporting our hypothesis that H(2)S mediates the vasoactivity of garlic.

The elution step is carried out with 1.0molL(-1) HNO(3). The effect of the experimental parameters, including sample pH, sampling flow rate, buffer and eluent concentrations were investigated by means of a 2(4) full factorial design, while for the final optimization a Doehlert design was employed. Under the best experimental conditions the preconcentration system provided detection and quantification limits of 2.6 and 8.6mugL(-1), respectively. A wide linear range varying from 8.6 up to 775mugL(-1) (r>0.999) and the respective precision (relative standard deviation) of 7.7 and 1.4% for the 15 and 200mugL(-1) levels were obtained.

In this study, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of cycloalliin in rats after intravenous or oral administration. Cycloalliin and its metabolite, (3R,5S)-5-methyl-1,4-thiazane-3-carboxylic acid, in plasma, urine, feces, and organs was determined by a validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. When administered intravenously at 50 mg/kg, cycloalliin was rapidly eliminated from blood and excreted into urine, and its total recovery in urine was 97.8% +/- 1.3% in 48 h. After oral administration, cycloalliin appeared rapidly in plasma, with a tmax of 0.47 +/- 0.03 h at 25 mg/kg and 0.67 +/- 0.14 h at 50 mg/kg. Orally administered cycloalliin was distributed in heart, lung, liver, spleen, and especially kidney. The Cmax and AUC0-inf values of cycloalliin at 50 mg/kg were approximately 5 times those at 25 mg/kg. When administered orally at 50 mg/kg, cycloalliin was excreted into urine (17.6% +/- 4.2%) but not feces.

Although not usually associated with severe morbidity, oropharyngeal candidiasis can be clinically significant, as it can interfere with the administration of medications and adequate nutritional intake, and may spread to the esophagus. Azole antifungal agents are commonly prescribed for the treatment and prophylaxis of candidal infections, however, the emergence of drug resistant strains and dose limiting toxic effects has complicated the treatment of candidiasis. Consequently, safe and effective and affordable medicine is required to combat this fungus. Commercial garlic (Allium sativum) has been used since time immemorial as a natural antibiotic, however, very little is known about the antifungal properties of two indigenous South African species of garlic, namely Tulbaghia alliacea and Tulbaghia violacea, used as folk medicines for a variety of infections. This study compares the in vitro anticandidal activity of Tulbaghia alliacea, Tulbaghia violacea and Allium sativum extracts. It was found that the greatest concentrations of inhibitory components were extracted by chloroform or water. The IC50 concentrations of Tulbaghia alliacea were 0.007-0.038% (w/v). Assays using S. cerevisiae revealed that the T. alliacea extract was fungicidal, with a killing half-life of approximately 2 h. This inhibitory effect of the T. alliacea extracts was observed via TLC, and may be due to an active compound called marasmicin, that was identified using NMR.

The selenium species were extracted from garlic cultivated in experimental plots by proteolytic enzymes, which ensured liberation of selenium species contained in peptides or proteins. Separate extractions using an aqueous solution of enzyme-deactivating hydroxylamine hydrochloride counteracted the possible degradation of labile selenium species by enzymes (such as alliinase) that occur naturally in garlic. The selenium content in garlic, which was analysed by ICP-MS, showed that addition of mycorrhiza to the natural soil increased the selenium uptake by garlic tenfold to 15 microg g(-1) (dry mass). Fertilisation with selenate and addition of mycorrhiza strongly increased the selenium content in garlic to around one part per thousand. The parallel analysis of the sample extracts by cation exchange and reversed-phase HPLC with ICP-MS detection showed that gamma-glutamyl-Se-methyl-selenocysteine amounted to 2/3, whereas methylselenocysteine, selenomethionine and selenate each amounted to a few percent of the total chromatographed selenium in all garlic samples.

Se-methionine and Se-methylselenocysteine were determined by monitoring their product ions. Another compound, gamma-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine, shown to be the most abundant form of Se in the garlic, was determined without any additional sample pre-treatment after extraction and without the need for a synthesized standard. Product ions for this dipeptide were detected by LC-ESI-MS-MS for three isotopes of Se-78 Se, 80Se: and 82Se. The method was extended to the species extracted during in-vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Because both Se-methylselenocysteine and gamma-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine have anticarcinogenic properties, their extractability and stability during human digestion are very important. Garlic was also treated with saliva, to enable detection and analysis of species extracted during mastication. Detailed information on the extractability of selenium species by both simulated gastric and intestinal fluid are given, and variation of the distribution of Se among the different species with time is discussed. Although the main species in garlic is the dipeptide gamma-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine, Se-methylselenocysteine is the main compound present in the extracts after treatment with gastrointestinal fluids. Two more, so far unknown compounds were observed in the chromatogram. The extracted species and their transformations were analysed by combining LC-ICP-MS and LC-ESI-MS-MS. In both the simulated gastric and intestinal digests, Se-methionine, Se-methylselenocysteine, and gamma-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine could be determined by LC-ESI-MS-MS by measuring their typical product ions.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D002853', 'D005737', 'D013058', 'D016566', 'D012643', 'D012680', 'D013997']","['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Garlic', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Organoselenium Compounds', 'Selenium', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors']",Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS): a powerful combination for selenium speciation in garlic (Allium sativum).,"['Q000295', 'Q000737', 'Q000295', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None]","['instrumentation', 'chemistry', 'instrumentation', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16435092,2007,1.0,1.0,,,

Although a great effort is made to understand the pharmaceutical mechanisms of garlic and its derivatives, there are many mysteries to be uncovered. Using proteomic means, herein we have systematically studied the responses of protein expression in BGC823 cells, a gastric cancer cell line, induced by diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a major component of garlic derivatives. A total of 41 unique proteins in BGC823 were detected with significant changes in their expression levels corresponding with DATS administration. Of these proteins, five typical ones, glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi), voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC-1), Annexin I, Galectin and S100A11, were further examined by Western blotting, resulting in coincident data with the proteomic evidence. Moreover quantitative real-time RT-PCR experiments offered dynamic data of mRNA expression, indicating the responses of Annexin I and GST-pi expression within a short period after DATS treatment. Interestingly, approximately 50% of DATS-sensitive proteins (19/41) in BGC823 are tightly associated with apoptotic pathways.

This study was aimed at clarifying the molecular basis of this anticancer effect of garlic by using human colon cancer cell lines HCT-15 and DLD-1. The growth of the cells was significantly suppressed by diallyl trisulfide (DATS, HCT-15 IC50 = 11.5 microM, DLD-1 IC50 = 13.3 microM); however, neither diallyl monosulfide nor diallyl disulfide showed such an effect. The proportion of HCT-15 and that of DLD-1 cells residing at the G1 and S phases were decreased by DATS, and their populations at the G2/M phase were markedly increased for up to 12 h. The cells with a sub-G1 DNA content were increased thereafter. Caspase-3 activity was also dramatically increased by DATS. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis performed on the cells arrested at the G1/S boundary revealed cell cycle-dependent induction of apoptosis through the transition of the G2/M phase to the G1 phase by DATS. DATS inhibited tubulin polymerization in an in vitro cell-free system. DATS disrupted microtubule network formation of the cells, and microtubule fragments could be seen at the interphase.

15949130,"Garlic extract significantly inhibited the oxidation of methyl linoleate in homogeneous acetonitrile solution, whereas the antioxidant effect of allicin-free garlic extract, prepared by removing allicin by prepared by removing allicin by preparative HPLC, was much lower than that of the garlic extract. These results suggest that the antioxidant properties are mostly attributed to the presence of allicin in the garlic extract. Allicin a major component of the thiosulfinates in garlic extract, was found to be effective for inhibiting methyl linoleate oxidation, but its efficiency was less than that of alpha-tocopherol. Next, the reactivity of allicin toward the peroxyl radical, which is a chain-propagating species, was investigated by direct ESR detection. The addition allicin to 2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile)-peroxyl radical solution caused the signal intensity of the peroxyl radical to dose-dependently decrease, indicating that allicin is capable of scavenging the the peroxyl radical and acting as an antioxidant. Finally, we studied the structure-anioxidant activity relationship for thiosulfinates and suggested that the combination of the allyl group (-CH2CH=CH2) and the -S(O)S- group is necessary for the antioxidant action of thiosulfinates in the garlic extract. In addition, one of the two possible combinations, -S(O)S-CH2CH=CH2, was found to make a much larger contribution to the antioxidant activity of the thiosulfinates than the other, CH2=CH-CH2-S(O)S-.",Redox report : communications in free radical research,"['D000097', 'D000975', 'D002851', 'D004305', 'D004578', 'D005737', 'D008041', 'D008956', 'D004364', 'D010936', 'D010946', 'D012997', 'D013441', 'D013696', 'D013885']","['Acetonitriles', 'Antioxidants', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Garlic', 'Linoleic Acids', 'Models, Chemical', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Extracts', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Solvents', 'Sulfinic Acids', 'Temperature', 'Thiosulfates']",Antioxidant activity of thiosulfinates derived from garlic.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000494', None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'pharmacology', None, None, 'pharmacology', 'metabolism', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15949130,2006,2.0,1.0,,,

Diallyl disulfide (DADS) is a naturally occurring organosulfur compound, from garlic (Allium sativum), which exerts anti-neoplasm activity. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of DADS on NAT activity and gene expresseion (NAT mRNA) in human esophagus epidermoid carcinoma CE 81T/VGH cells. NAT activity was measured by the amounts of N-acetylation of 2-aminofluorene (AF) and non-acetylation of AF by high performance liquid chromatography on cells treated with or without DADS. The amounts of NAT enzymes were examined and analyzed by Western blot. NAT gene expression (NAT mRNA) was examined by polymerase chain reaction and cDNA microarray. DADS decreased the amount of N-acetylation of AF in human esophagus epidermoid carcinoma CE 81T/VGH cells in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis indicated that DADS decreased the levels of NAT protein in CE 81T/VGH cells. PCR and cDNA microarray experiments showed that DADS affected NAT1 mRNA expression in CE 81T/VGH cells.

15749632,"Garlic consumption is linked with lower incidences of certain cancers perhaps because garlic-derived allyl sulfides inhibit nitrosamine activation by cytochrome P450s. To help evaluate this view, effects of allyl sulfides on O6-methylguanine (O6MG) levels were examined in liver of rats injected with 20 mg/kg of liver carcinogen dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) and killed 3 h later. DNA was isolated and hydrolyzed, and O6MG/guanine ratios were determined by HPLC-fluorescence. Mean inhibition of O6MG formation fell from 89% for 200 to 33% for 12 mg diallyl sulfide (DAS) per kilogram gavaged 18 h before DMN injection. Gavage of DAS 3 or 6 h (instead of 18 h) before DMN injection significantly reduced inhibitions. Mean inhibitions for diallyl disulfide, diallyl sulfoxide, and diallyl sulfone (75-100 mg/kg) gavaged 18 h before DMN were 39%, 72%, and 82%. In lung and kidney, DAS produced mean inhibitions of 98% and 74% compared with 89% in liver. When methylnitrosourea was injected instead of DMN, neither DAS nor DADS inhibited O6MG formation in liver DNA. Feeding 2.5% garlic for 7 days inhibited DMN-induced O6MG formation in liver DNA by 46%, similar to that expected from the estimated yield of allyl sulfides from garlic.

This crop is mainly known for its flavor and odor, although the many medicinal properties that are attributed to it, including anticarcinogenic, antiatherosclerotic, and antithrombotic potential, among several others, have called the attention of scientists since very early times. It is known that sulfur-containing volatiles are the principal compounds responsible for such properties. The aims of this work were to develop a solventless extraction method for sulfur-containing volatiles from garlic, as well as their chemical characterization. Since garlic volatiles are rather thermolabile, low-pressure hydrodistillation was chosen as the extracting method. The analysis of all compounds was performed on an HP-FFAP chromatographic column mounted in a GC-MS system. For volatile transfer and injection method, solid-phase microextraction was selected, with the use of eight different fibers. The most abundant volatile compound was diallyl disulfide, followed by diallyl trisulfide.

This pest not only affects plants by sucking on the phloem, but it also transmits single-stranded RNA luteoviruses while feeding, which cause disease and damage in the crop. The mannose-binding Allium sativum (garlic) leaf lectin has been found to be a potent control agent of L. erysimi. The lectin receptor protein isolated from brush border membrane vesicle of insect gut was purified to determine the mechanism of lectin binding to the gut. Purified receptor was identified as an endosymbiotic chaperonin, symbionin, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Symbionin from endosymbionts of other aphid species have been reported to play a significant role in virus transmission by binding to the read-through domain of the viral coat protein. To understand the molecular interactions of the said lectin and this unique symbionin molecule, the model structures of both molecules were generated using the Modeller program. The interaction was confirmed through docking of the two molecules forming a complex. A surface accessibility test of these molecules demonstrated a significant reduction in the accessibility of the complex molecule compared with that of the free symbionin molecule. This reduction in surface accessibility may have an effect on other molecular interactive processes, including ""symbionin virion recognition"", which is essential for such symbionin-mediated virus transmission.

Optimum CO(2)-SFE conditions provided 96% recovery for allicin with precision of 3% (RSD) for repeat samples. The incorporation of an internal standard (allyl phenyl sulfone) in the SFE step resulted in a modest improvement in recovery (99%) and precision (2% RSD). Standard additions of alliin were converted to allicin in situ by endogenous alliinase (l-(+)-S-alk(en)ylcysteine sulfoxide lyase, EC 4.4.1.4). Complete conversion of the spiked alliin to allicin was achieved by making additions after homogenization-induced conversion of the naturally occurring cysteine sulfoxides to thiosulfinates had taken place, thus eliminating the likelihood of competing reactions.

After animals were force-fed these compounds, tissue GSTs were purified and individual subunits resolved by HPLC and identified on the basis of mass spectrometry (ESI MS) and immunoreactivity data. The effects of DADS and allicin on GST expression were especially prominent in stomach and small intestine, where there were major coordinate changes in GST subunit profiles. In particular, the transcripts of the mGSTM1 and mGSTM4 genes, which share large segments of common 5'-flanking sequences, and their corresponding subunits were selectively induced. Levels of alpha class subunits also increased, whereas mGSTM3 and mGSTP1 were not affected. The inducible mGSTA5 and non-responsive mGSTM3 subunits had not been identified previously. Liver and colon GSTs were also affected to a lesser extent, but this short-term feeding regimen had no effect on GST subunit patterns from other organs, including heart, brain and testis. Real-time PCR (TaqMan) methods were used for quantitative estimations of relative amounts of the mRNAs encoding the GSTs. Effects on the transcripts generally paralleled changes at the protein level, for the most part, however, the greatest relative increases were observed for those mRNAs that were expressed at low abundance constituitively. Mechanisms by which the organosulfur compounds operate to affect GST transcription could involve reversible modification of certain protein sulfhydryl groups, shifts in reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratios and resultant changes in cellular redox status.",Carcinogenesis,"['D000498', 'D000818', 'D001483', 'D002851', 'D004220', 'D041981', 'D005786', 'D005982', 'D008099', 'D051379', 'D008969', 'D016415', 'D013457']","['Allyl Compounds', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Disulfides', 'Gastrointestinal Tract', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'Liver', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sulfur Compounds']",Selective expression of glutathione S-transferase genes in the murine gastrointestinal tract in response to dietary organosulfur compounds.,"['Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000502', 'Q000096', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000378']","['metabolism', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'physiology', 'biosynthesis', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14633659,2004,0.0,0.0,,,

Six hundred samples of 15 vegetables cultivated during different seasons were analysed for nitrate and nitrite by ion chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometry, respectively. No significant variance in nitrate levels was found for most vegetables cultivated during the summer and winter harvests. The mean nitrates level was higher in A. tuberosum Roth (5150 mg kg(-1)) and spinach (4259 mg kg(-1)), intermediate in radish (1878 mg kg(-1)) and Chinese cabbage (1740 mg kg(-1)), and lower in onion (23 mg kg(-1)), soybean sprouts (56 mg kg(-1)) and green pepper (76 mg kg(-1)) compared with those in other vegetables.

Garlic is extracted with an HCl solution to inhibit the formation of allicin, which interferes with the determination of sulfite.

HMS is determined by reversed-phase ion-pairing liquid chromatography with post-column detection. The post-column reaction system consists of the addition of KOH to convert HMS to sulfite ion, followed by the addition of 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) to produce 5-mercapto-2-nitrobenzoic acid which is detected spectrophotometrically at 450 nm.

The garlic metabolite diallydisulfide (1-100 micro mol/L) also significantly reduced IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. Interestingly, exposure of human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293) cells to GPE-treated blood sample supernatants (10 or 100 mg/L) reduced NF-kappaB activity compared with cells exposed to untreated blood supernatants as measured by a NF-kappaB-driven luciferase reporter gene assay. Blood samples treated with extract obtained from unfertilized garlic (100 mg/L) reduced NF-kappaB activity by 25%, whereas blood samples treated with sulfur-fertilized garlic extracts (100 mg/L) lowered NF-kappaB activity by 41%.

12642382,"(1) Ajoene is a garlic compound with anti-platelet properties and, in addition, was shown to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis by affecting 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and late enzymatic steps of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. (2) MVA constitutes the precursor not only of cholesterol, but also of a number of non-sterol isoprenoids, such as farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups. Covalent attachment of these MVA-derived isoprenoid groups (prenylation) is a required function of several proteins that regulate cell proliferation. We investigated the effect of ajoene on rat aortic smooth muscle cell proliferation as related to protein prenylation. (3) Cell counting, DNA synthesis, and cell cycle analysis showed that ajoene (1-50 micro M) interfered with the progression of the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and inhibited rat SMC proliferation. (4) Similar to the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin, ajoene inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis. However, in contrast to simvastatin, the antiproliferative effect of ajoene was not prevented by the addition of MVA, farnesol (FOH), and geranylgeraniol (GGOH). Labelling of smooth muscle cell cellular proteins with [3H]-FOH and [3H]-GGOH was significantly inhibited by ajoene. (5) In vitro assays for protein farnesyltransferase (PFTase) and protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (PGGTase-I) confirmed that ajoene inhibits protein prenylation. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry analyses also demonstrated that ajoene causes a covalent modification of the cysteine SH group of a peptide substrate for protein PGGTase-I.

The aim was to identify and analyse the metabolites produced in vivo after a single oral administration of 200 mg kg(-1) DADS to rats. The organic sulphur metabolites present in the stomach, liver, plasma and urine were measured by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry over 15 days. 3. Data indicate that DADS is absorbed and transformed into allyl mercaptan, allyl methyl sulphide, allyl methyl sulphoxide (AMSO) and allyl methyl sulphone (AMSO(2)), which are detected throughout the excretion period. Overall, the highest amounts of metabolites were measured 48-72h after the DADS administration. AMSO(2) is the most abundant and persistent of these compounds. The levels of all the sulphur compounds rapidly decline within the first week after administration and disappear during the second week. Only AMSO and AMSO(2) are significantly excreted in urine. 4.

The work described here involved the study of the inhibitory power of Allium sativum extracts against the in vitro growth of Hp (Hp ivg). We used purple garlic of the ""Las Pedroñeras"" variety for this study. The effects of two different extraction methods (Soxhlet, stirred tank extractor) and four solvents with different characteristics (water, acetone, ethanol, and hexane) were investigated in terms of the efficiency of the extraction process. Satisfactory results were obtained in most cases in the activity tests, indicating that different extracts gave rise to good inhibitory activity against Hp ivg. The extracts that showed the highest bacteriostatic activities were selected to evaluate the influence of the most important operation variables on the extraction yield: stirring speed, operation time, garlic conditioning, and garlic storage time. The best results were obtained using ethanol and acetone as solvents in a stirred tank. The inhibitory powers of these extracts were compared to those shown by some commercial antibiotics used in the medical treatment of Hp infections. The results of this study show that garlic extracts produce levels of inhibition similar to those of the commercial materials. These extracts were also tested against other common bacteria, and equally satisfactory results were obtained. The research described here represents an important starting point in the fight against and/or prevention of peptic ulcers, as well as other pathologies associated with Hp infections such us gastric cancer.

The use of a new commercially available GC/ ICPMS interface in conjunction with solid-phase micro-extraction is a promising way to perform these studies.

12184391,"Caribbean sponges of the genus Ircinia contain high concentrations of linear furanosesterterpene tetronic acids (FTAs) and produce and exude low-molecular-weight volatile compounds (e.g., dimethyl sulfide, methyl isocyanide, methyl isothiocyanate) that give these sponges their characteristic unpleasant garlic odor. It has recently been suggested that FTAs are unlikely to function as antipredatory chemical defenses, and this function may instead be attributed to bioactive volatiles. We tested crude organic extracts and purified fractions isolated from Ircinia campana, I. felix, and I. strobilina at naturally occurring concentrations in laboratory and field feeding assays to determine their palatability to generalist fish predators. We also used a qualitative technique to test the crude volatile fraction from I. felix and I. strobilina and dimethylsulfide in laboratory feeding assays. Crude organic extracts of all three species deterred feeding of fishes in both aquarium and field experiments. Bioassay-directed fractionation resulted in the isolation of the FTA fraction as the sole active fraction of the nonvolatile crude extract for each species, and further assays of subfractions suggested that feeding deterrent activity is shared by the FTAs. FTAs deterred fish feeding in aquarium assays at concentrations as low as 0.5 mg/ml (fraction B, variabilin), while the natural concentrations of combined FTA fractions were > 5.0 mg/ml for all three species. In contrast, natural mixtures of volatiles transferred from sponge tissue to food pellets and pure dimethylsulfide incorporated into food pellets were readily eaten by fish in aquarium assays. Although FTAs may play other ecological roles in Ircinia spp., these compounds are effective as defenses against potential predatory fishes.

This reagent is not commercially available and must be synthesized. In this paper we describe the quantitative analysis of alliin and allicin, as well as of alliinase activity with 4-mercaptopyridine (4-MP), a commercially available chromogenic thiol. The assay is based on the reaction of 4-MP (lambda(max)=324nm) with the activated disulfide bond of thiosulfinates -S(O)-S-, forming the mixed disulfide, 4-allylmercaptothiopyridine, which has no absorbance at this region. The structure of 4-allylmercaptothiopyridine was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The method was used for the determination of alliin and allicin concentrations in their pure form as well as of alliin and total thiosulfinates concentrations in crude garlic preparations and garlic-derived products, at micromolar concentrations.

This study was conducted to get insight into the perspectives for monitoring the intake of garlic by a biomarker approach. Chemically, the biomarker results from exposure to gamma-glutamyl-S-allyl-l-cysteine, which is first hydrolysed by gamma-glutamine-transpeptidase resulting in the formation of S-allyl-l-cysteine. The latter compound is subsequently N-acetylated by N-acetyltransferase into S-allyl-mercapturic acid (ALMA) and excreted into urine. The mercapturic acid was measured in urine using gaschromatography with mass spectrometry. Thus the intake of garlic was determined to check the compliance of garlic intake in a placebo-controlled intervention study. Results indicate that S-allyl-mercapturic acid could be detected in 15 out of 16 urine samples of garlic supplement takers, indicating good compliance. In addition, the intake of garlic was also monitored in a cross-section study of vegans versus controls in Finland, in which no differences in garlic consumption nor in ALMA output were recorded between vegans and controls.

The recovery of thiometon was found to depend on the lot of ethyl acetate. A 2-year-old lot of ethyl acetate caused degradation of thiometon, but a fresh lot of ethyl acetate did not. Analysis showed that ethyl acetate stored for 2 years contained about 5 microL/mL of acetaldehyde. Thiometon was also degraded by acetone or acetonitrile, when acetaldehyde was added to them, in the same manner as by aged ethyl acetate. The fact that the recovery of thiometon from welsh onions was about 100% indicated that some of the mercaptans in allium vegetables may prevent thiometon degradation.

11401577,"Allium sativum agglutinin (ASAI) is a heterodimeric mannose-specific bulb lectin possessing two polypeptide chains of molecular mass 11.5 and 12.5 kDa. The thermal unfolding of ASAI, characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism, shows it to be highly reversible and can be defined as a two-state process in which the folded dimer is converted directly to the unfolded monomers (A2 if 2U). Its conformational stability has been determined as a function of temperature, GdnCl concentration, and pH using a combination of thermal and isothermal GdnCl-induced unfolding monitored by DSC, far-UV CD, and fluorescence, respectively. Analyses of these data yielded the heat capacity change upon unfolding (DeltaC(p) and also the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic parameters, namely, DeltaG, DeltaH, and DeltaS. The fit of the stability curve to the modified Gibbs-Helmholtz equation provides an estimate of the thermodynamic parameters DeltaH(g), DeltaS(g), and DeltaC(p) as 174.1 kcal x mol(-1), 0.512 kcal x mol(-1) x K(-1), and 3.41 kcal x mol(-1) x K(-1), respectively, at T(g) = 339.4 K. Also, the free energy of unfolding, DeltaG(s), at its temperature of maximum stability (T(s) = 293 K) is 13.13 kcal x mol(-1). Unlike most oligomeric proteins studied so far, the lectin shows excellent agreement between the experimentally determined DeltaC(p) (3.2 +/- 0.28 kcal x mol(-1) x K(-1)) and those evaluated from a calculation of its accessible surface area. This in turn suggests that the protein attains a completely unfolded state irrespective of the method of denaturation. The absence of any folding intermediates suggests the quaternary interactions to be the major contributor to the conformational stability of the protein, which correlates well with its X-ray structure. The small DeltaC(p) for the unfolding of ASAI reflects a relatively small, buried hydrophobic core in the folded dimeric protein.",Biochemistry,"['D000373', 'D002151', 'D002352', 'D002942', 'D037222', 'D018548', 'D019281', 'D005737', 'D037102', 'D008351', 'D037241', 'D008956', 'D037121', 'D010940', 'D018517', 'D010946', 'D011489', 'D017510', 'D017433', 'D013050', 'D013816']","['Agglutinins', 'Calorimetry', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Collectins', 'Cotyledon', 'Dimerization', 'Garlic', 'Lectins', 'Mannans', 'Mannose-Binding Lectins', 'Models, Chemical', 'Plant Lectins', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plant Roots', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Thermodynamics']",The reversible two-state unfolding of a monocot mannose-binding lectin from garlic bulbs reveals the dominant role of the dimeric interface in its stabilization.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, None]","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11401577,2001,0.0,0.0,,,

The results showed that Omegacoeur (0.1 mM) increased Na,K-ATPase activity by 40% without changes in 5'-nucleotidase activity.

The goal of this study was to compare certain biological activities of Se-garlic and Se-yeast and to elucidate the differences based on the chemical forms of selenium found in these two natural products. Characterization of organic selenium compounds in yeast (1922 microg/g Se) and garlic (296 microg/g Se) was carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry or with electrospray mass spectrometry. Analytical speciation studies showed that the bulk of the selenium in Se-garlic and Se-yeast is in the form of gamma-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine (73%) and selenomethionine (85%), respectively. The above methodology has the sensitivity and capability to account for >90% of total selenium. In the rat feeding studies, supplementation of Se-garlic in the diet at different levels consistently caused a lower total tissue selenium accumulation when compared to Se-yeast. On the other hand, Se-garlic was significantly more effective in suppressing the development of premalignant lesions and the formation of adenocarcinomas in the mammary gland of carcinogen-treated rats. Given the present finding on the identity of selenomethionine and gamma-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine as the major form of selenium in Se-yeast and Se-garlic, respectively, the metabolism of these two compounds is discussed in an attempt to elucidate how their disposition in tissues might account for the differences in cancer chemopreventive activity.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000230', 'D000818', 'D016588', 'D002273', 'D005260', 'D005737', 'D006801', 'D008325', 'D008517', 'D010946', 'D011230', 'D051381', 'D017207', 'D018036', 'D018038', 'D015003']","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents', 'Carcinogens', 'Female', 'Garlic', 'Humans', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Precancerous Conditions', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Selenium Compounds', 'Sodium Selenite', 'Yeasts']",Chemical speciation influences comparative activity of selenium-enriched garlic and yeast in mammary cancer prevention.,"['Q000139', None, 'Q000627', None, None, 'Q000627', None, 'Q000139', None, None, 'Q000139', None, None, 'Q000627', 'Q000627', None]","['chemically induced', None, 'therapeutic use', None, None, 'therapeutic use', None, 'chemically induced', None, None, 'chemically induced', None, None, 'therapeutic use', 'therapeutic use', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10888499,2000,0.0,0.0,,,

In particular, a comparison was made between the level of control of breath odor provided by the test dentifrice, and that provided by a placebo dentifrice which did not contain triclosan or a copolymer. This study followed a two-treatment, two-period crossover design. Prospective subjects were provided with a supply of a commercially available fluoride dentifrice, which was used for a one-week period prior to the two seven-day treatment periods. During each treatment period, subjects were instructed to brush their teeth twice a day, morning and evening, for sixty seconds with their assigned study dentifrice, using the soft-bristled toothbrush which had been provided. On the morning following the seventh day of each treatment period, subjects reported to the clinical facility for overnight breath odor assessments. Directly following this, subjects brushed their teeth, ate and drank normally, and reported once again to the clinical facility at seven hours post-toothbrushing for another breath odor assessment. Prior to the overnight breath odor assessments, subjects refrained from brushing their teeth, rinsing their mouths or using breath mints, and from eating or drinking anything on the morning of the evaluation. Subjects refrained from the use of tobacco products, and from eating onions, garlic, or strong spices throughout the entire study. Breath odor was instrumentally evaluated by measuring the level of volatile sulfur compounds in the mouth air using a 565 Tracor gas chromatograph equipped with a flame photometric detector. Measurements were taken in duplicate, and then averaged. Levels of volatile sulfur compounds were expressed in nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) of mouth air. The two dentifrices exhibited statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) with respect to both overnight breath odor and seven-hour post-toothbrushing breath odor. The mean overnight breath odor scores were 9.63 ng/ml for Colgate Total Toothpaste, and 12.64 ng/ml for the placebo dentifrice.

We have used the N-methylnitrosourea (NMU)-induced rat mammary tumor model to test the chemopreventive effects of a water-soluble organosulfur constituent derived from aged garlic, S-allylcysteine (SAC). Rats were fed diets supplemented with 666 and 2,000 ppm SAC beginning seven days before initiation with NMU (55 days of age) to termination (18 wk post-NMU), at which time mammary tumors were enumerated. At neither dose did SAC exert an inhibitory effect on any index of tumor development, including incidence, latency, multiplicity, or volume, compared with untreated controls. Weight gains in all groups were similar. Assay of serum SAC levels in supplemented groups indicated that SAC concentrations were beneath the limits of detection of the high-performance liquid chromatography system used.

The delay time for detection of sample after introduction into the sample vessel was determined as 43 s. The system proved to be reliable and robust with no loss in sensitivity or contamination of the mass spectrometer over a 6 month period. The technique was applied to a homologous series of aliphatic alcohols from C(2) to C(7). Results showed that as polarity decreased with increasing chain length the release of volatile into the headspace was faster and gave a higher maximum intensity.

A recent study suggested that marinating meat may offer a way to reduce HAA formation. Hawaii's diverse ethnic populations, which are at various risks of colorectal cancer, often use traditional marinades when cooking meat. We compared the HAA content of beef steaks marinated overnight with teriyaki sauce, turmeric-garlic sauce, or commercial honey barbecue sauce with that of unmarinated steaks. The levels of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) were determined by liquid-liquid extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Beef steaks marinated with teriyaki sauce had 45% and 67% lower PhIP level at 10 minutes (p = 0.002) and 15 minutes (p = 0.001) of cooking time as well as 44% and 60% lower MeIQx levels at 10 minutes (p = 0.008) and 15 minutes (p = 0.001), respectively, than unmarinated meat. Lower levels of PhIP and MeIQx were also observed in meat marinated with turmeric-garlic sauce. In contrast, marinating with barbecue sauce caused a 2.9- and 1.9-fold increase in PhIP (p < or = 0.005) and a 4- and 2.9-fold increase in MeIQx (p < or = 0.001) at 10 and 15 minutes, respectively. Differences in the mutagenic activities of marinated and unmarinated steaks, as measured by the Ames assay, paralleled the differences in PhIP and MeIQx levels.

10497175,"We report herein for the first time the formation by freshly grown garlic roots and the structural characterization of 14,15-epoxide positional analogs of the hepoxilins formed via the 15-lipoxygenase-induced oxygenation of arachidonic acid. These compounds are formed through the combined actions of a 15(S)-lipoxygenase and a hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HPETE) isomerase. The compounds were formed when either arachidonic acid or 15-HPETE were used as substrates. Both the ""A""-type and the ""B""-type products are formed although the B-type compounds are formed in greater relative quantities. Chiral phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis confirmed the formation of hepoxilins from 15(S)- but not 15(R)-HPETE, indicating high stereoselectivity of the isomerase. Additionally, the lipoxygenase was of the 15(S)-type as only 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid was formed when arachidonic acid was used as substrate. The structures of the products were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the methyl ester trimethylsilyl ether derivatives as well as after characteristic epoxide ring opening catalytically with hydrogen leading to dihydroxy products. That 15(S)-lipoxygenase activity is of functional importance in garlic was shown by the inhibition of root growth by BW 755C, a dual cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, a lipoxygenase inhibitor. Additional biological studies were carried out with the purified intact 14(S), 15(S)-hepoxilins, which were investigated for hepoxilin-like actions in causing the release of intracellular calcium in human neutrophils. The 14,15-hepoxilins dose-dependently caused a rise in cytosolic calcium, but their actions were 5-10-fold less active than 11(S), 12(S)-hepoxilins derived from 12(S)-HPETE. These studies provide evidence that 15(S)-lipoxygenase is functionally important to normal root growth and that HPETE isomerization into the hepoxilin-like structure may be ubiquitous; the hepoxilin-evoked release of calcium in human neutrophils, which is receptor-mediated, is sensitive to the location within the molecule of the hydroxyepoxide functionality.",The Journal of biological chemistry,"['D015126', 'D001093', 'D002851', 'D005737', 'D006801', 'D019746', 'D009504', 'D018517', 'D010946', 'D011956']","['8,11,14-Eicosatrienoic Acid', 'Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Garlic', 'Humans', 'Intramolecular Oxidoreductases', 'Neutrophils', 'Plant Roots', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Receptors, Cell Surface']","Formation of 14,15-hepoxilins of the A(3) and B(3) series through a 15-lipoxygenase and hydroperoxide isomerase present in garlic roots.","['Q000031', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000201', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000201', None, 'Q000378']","['analogs & derivatives', 'metabolism', None, 'enzymology', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'enzymology', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10497175,1999,0.0,0.0,1.0,,

After four cycles of field cultivation, the selected somaclones (variants) in the fourth generation showed significant differences in bulb character compared with the original plants. Mitotic division and chromosomal abnormalities were investigated in meristimic root tip cells of regenerated plants for the first and fourth regeneration and for control plants. Somaclonal variant metaphase cells had the same chromosome number (2n = 16) as those of the controls. Allicin was measured quantitatively in the regenerated clones by high-performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that some clones contained as much as 14.50 mg/g allicin, compared with 3.80 mg/g in the control plant. This finding suggests that this technique may be useful to improve the allicin content of Egyptian garlic, which could be utilized as a good source for garlic-containing pharmaceutical preparations.",Journal of medicinal food,[],[],Chemical and Genetic Evaluation of Somaclonal Variants of Egyptian Garlic (Allium sativum L.).,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19281347,2012,,,,,

We have purified alliinase from shoots of Allium tuberosum (Chinese chive) to apparent homogeneity by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A cDNA clone encoding alliinase was isolated from a cDNA library constructed from whole plants of A. tuberosum by hybridization screening with a synthetic 50-residue oligonucleotide encoding a conserved region of the alliinases from onion and garlic. The isolated cDNA encoded a protein of 476 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 54083 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited 66-69% identities with those of reported alliinases from onion, garlic and shallot. The partial amino acid sequence, which was determined for a V8 protease-digested peptide fragment of the purified alliinase, was perfectly matched with the sequence deduced from the cDNA. An expression vector of recombinant alliinase cDNA was constructed in yeast. The catalytically active protein was in the soluble fraction of transformed yeast. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicated that Lys280 was essential for the catalytic activity and, thus, a possible Pxy-P-binding residue. The mRNA expression of the alliinase gene comprising a multigene family in the shoots of green plants was twofold higher than that in the roots of green plants; however, the expression in the shoots of etiolated plants was only 13% that in green shoots, although the expression in the roots was not remarkably different between in green and etiolated plants.

9488677,"Two mannose-binding lectins, Allium sativum agglutinin (ASA) I (25 kDa) and ASAIII (48 kDa), from garlic bulbs have been purified by affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration. The subunit structures of these lectins are different, but they display similar sugar specificities. Both ASAI and ASAIII are made up of 12.5- and 11.5-kDa subunits. In addition, a complex (136 kDa) comprising a polypeptide chain of 54 +/- 4 kDa and the subunits of ASAI and ASAIII elutes earlier than these lectins on gel filtration. The 54-kDa subunit is proven to be alliinase, which is known to form a complex with garlic lectins. Constituent subunits of ASAI and ASAIII exhibit the same sequence at their amino termini. ASAI and ASAIII recognize monosaccharides in mannosyl configuration. The potencies of the ligands for ASAs increase in the following order: mannobiose (Manalpha1-3Man) < mannotriose (Manalpha1-6Manalpha1-3Man) approximately mannopentaose < Man9-oligosaccharide. The addition of two GlcNAc residues at the reducing end of mannotriose or mannopentaose enhances their potencies significantly, whereas substitution of both alpha1-3- and alpha1-6-mannosyl residues of mannotriose with GlcNAc at the nonreducing end increases their activity only marginally. The best manno-oligosaccharide ligand is Man9GlcNAc2Asn, which bears several alpha1-2-linked mannose residues. Interaction with glycoproteins suggests that these lectins recognize internal mannose as well as bind to the core pentasaccharide of N-linked glycans even when it is sialylated. The strongest inhibitors are the high mannose-containing glycoproteins, which carry larger glycan chains. Indeed, invertase, which contains 85% of its mannose residues in species larger than Man20GlcNAc, exhibited the highest binding affinity.

We report that the induction of glutathione (GSH) S-transferase pi (mGSTP1-1) by a chemo-preventive agent can be used as a reliable marker to assess its efficacy in retarding chemical carcinogenesis induced by benzo(a)pyrene (BP), which is a widespread environmental pollutant and believed to be a risk factor in human chemical carcinogenesis. This conclusion is based on 1) the relative contribution of mGSTP1-1 of the liver and forestomach of female A/J mice in the detoxification of the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of BP, (+)-anti-7,8-dihydroxy-9, 10-oxy-7,8,9, 10-tetrahydrobenzo(a)pyrene [(+)-anti-BPDE]; and 2) a positive correlation between the induction of hepatic and forestomach mGSTP1-1 by 5 naturally occurring organosulfides (OSCs) from garlic (diallyl sulfide, diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, dipropyl sulfide and dipropyl disulfide) and their effectiveness in preventing BP-induced forestomach neoplasia in mice. In the liver, the combined contribution of other GSTs in the detoxification of (+)-anti-BPDE was far less than the contribution of mGSTP1-1 alone. Likewise, in the forestomach, the contribution of mGSTP1-1 far exceeded the combined contribution of other GSTs. Studies on the effects of OSCs against BP-induced forestomach neoplasia revealed a good correlation between their chemo-preventive efficacy and their ability to induce mGSTP1-1 expression in the liver (r = -0.89; p < 0.05) as well as in the forestomach (r = -0.97; p < 0.05).

Mutagenic activity was lower in marinated samples cooked for 10, 20 and 30 min, but higher in the marinated samples cooked for 40 min, compared with unmarinated controls. Although a change in free amino acids, which are heterocyclic amine precursors, might explain the decrease in PhIP and increase in MeIQx, no such change was detected.

9147057,"A procedure developed to separate the homodimeric and heterodimeric mannose-binding lectins from bulbs of garlic (Allium sativum L.) and ramsons (Allium ursinum L.) also enabled the isolation of stable lectin-alliinase complexes. Characterization of the individual lectins indicated that, in spite of their different molecular structure, the homomeric and heteromeric lectins resemble each other reasonably well with respect to their agglutination properties and carbohydrate-binding specificity. However, a detailed analysis of the lectin-alliinase complexes from garlic and ramsons bulbs demonstrated that only the heterodimeric lectins are capable of binding to the glycan chains of the alliinase molecules (EC 4.4.1.4). Moreover, it appears that only a subpopulation of the alliinase molecules is involved in the formation of lectin-alliinase complexes and that the complexed alliinase contains more glycan chains than the free enzyme.

9084912,"The chemoprotective effects of diallyl sulfide (DAS), a flavor component of garlic, have been attributed to its inhibitory effects on CYP2E1-mediated bioactivation of certain carcinogenic chemicals. In addition to being a competitive inhibitor of CYP2E1 in vitro, DAS is known to cause irreversible inhibition of CYP2E1 in rats in vivo. The latter property is believed to be mediated by the DAS metabolite diallyl sulfone (DASO2), which is thought to be a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP2E1, although the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In order to investigate the nature of the reactive intermediate(s) responsible for the inactivation of CYP2E1 by DAS and its immediate metabolites, the present studies were carried out to detect and identify potential glutathione (GSH) conjugates of DAS and its metabolites diallyl sulfoxide (DASO) and DASO2. By means of ionspray LC-MS/MS, ten GSH conjugates were identified in bile collected from rats dosed with DAS, namely: S-[3-(S'-allyl-S'-dioxomercapto)-2-hydroxypropyl]glutathione (M1, M2; diastereomers), S-[3-(S'-allyl-S'-dioxomercapto)-2-hydroxypropyl]-glutathione (M5), S-[2-(S'-allyl-S'-dioxomercapto)-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glutathion e (M3, M4; diastereomers), S-[3-(S'-allylmercapto)-2-hydroxypropyl]glutathione (M6), S-(3-hydroxypropyl)-glutathione (M7), S-(2-carboxyethyl)glutathione (M8), allyl glutathionyl disulfide (M9), and S-allylglutathione (M10). With the exception of M6, all of the above GSH conjugates were detected in the bile of rats treated with DASO, while only M3, M4, M5, M7, M8, and M10 were found in the bile of rats treated with DASO2. Experiments conducted in vitro showed that GSH reacted spontaneously with DASO to form conjugates M9 and M10, and with DASO2 to form M10. In the presence of NADPH and GSH, incubation of DAS with cDNA-expressed rat CYP2E1 resulted in the formation of metabolites M6, M9, and M10, while incubation with DASO led to the formation of M3, M4, M5, M9, and M10. When DASO2 acted as substrate, CYP2E1 generated only conjugates M3, M4, M5, and M10. These results indicate that while DAS and DASO undergo extensive oxidation in vivo at the sulfur atom, the allylic carbon, and the terminal double bonds, CYP2E1 preferentially catalyzes oxidation of the sulfur atom to form the sulfoxide and the sulfone (DASO and DASO2). However, it appears that the end product of this sequence, namely, DASO2, undergoes further CYP2E1-mediated activation of the olefinic pi-bond, a reaction which transforms many terminal olefins to potent mechanism-based P450 inhibitors. We hypothesize, therefore, that it is this final metabolic event with DASO2 which leads to autocatalytic destruction of CYP2E1 and which is mainly responsible for the chemoprotective effects of DAS in vivo.",Chemical research in toxicology,"['D000498', 'D000818', 'D000975', 'D001646', 'D002478', 'D002853', 'D019392', 'D065691', 'D008401', 'D005978', 'D009682', 'D008297', 'D051381', 'D017207', 'D013440']","['Allyl Compounds', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Bile', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Glutathione', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sulfides']",Metabolism of the chemoprotective agent diallyl sulfide to glutathione conjugates in rats.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, 'Q000378']","[None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9084912,1997,0.0,0.0,,no garlic,

Of the chemicals isolated, sulphur compounds, phenols, acids, ethyl esters and carbonyls could have particular importance to the overall chorizo flavour. In addition, the changes in the proportions of volatile compounds during the ripening of chorizo were tracked. Most of the volatiles increased during ripening, especially acids, alcohols, esters, phenols, ketones and terpenes. On comparing the distribution of the sulphur compounds observed in chorizo with that of garlic, some noteworthy differences were observed.

Animal studies suggest that up to 25% of orally administered tellurium is absorbed in the gut.

In this study the effects of DAS on the oxidative metabolism and hepatotoxicity induced by acetaminophen (APAP) in rats were investigated. In the hepatotoxicity evaluation of Fischer 344 rats there was a dose-dependent increase in the odds of mortality rate by APAP (P = 0.009); DAS treatment significantly protected rats from APAP-related mortality (P = 0.026). Liver toxicity determined by lactate dehydrogenase activity was significantly increased by APAP treatment (0.75 g/kg). Pretreatment with DAS protected animals from APAP-induced liver toxicity in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Treatment of DAS (50 mg/kg) 3 hr after APAP dosing significantly (P < 0.05) protected rats from APAP-induced liver toxicity. The metabolism of APAP (50 microM) in vitro was significantly inhibited by DAS (0.3-1 mM) in liver microsomes isolated from F344 rats. As the effect of DAS on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in vivo was observed only when DAS was administered before or shortly after (< 3 hr) APAP dosing, data suggested that the protective effect of DAS is mainly at the metabolic activation step of APAP.

Six organosulfur compounds - diallyl disulfide (DAD), dipropyl disulfide (DPD), diallyl sulfide (DAS), allyl methyl sulfide (AMS), allyl mercaptan (AM) and cysteine - were added separately to the pork juice before reflux boiling and then the mutagenicity of each sample was examined with the Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the presence of S9 mix.

The greatest inhibitory effect was observed with DAD and DPD, and this was 111-fold higher than that of the lowest, cysteine. To elucidate the inhibitory effect of DAD on mutagen formation in boiled pork juice, the major mutagenic fractions were monitored after HPLC separation by their mutagenicity with S. typhimurium TA98. By comparing the retention times of authentic IQ compounds from boiled pork juice with those following the addition of DAD, we showed that the mutagenicity of three major fractions was significantly inhibited compared with those same fractions in boiled pork juice alone. In addition, the Maillard reaction products (MRPs) in the boiled pork juice with and without the addition of DAD were quantified and identified by capillary gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results show that the reduction in the total amount of MRPs (pyridines, pyrazines, thiophenes and thiazoles) in boiled pork juice after boiling for 12 h is correlated with their mutagenicity.

8717417,"Garlic has been reported to provide protection against hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis and ischemia-reperfusion-induced arrhythmias and infarction. Oxygen free radicals (OFRs) have been implicated as causative factors in these diseases and antioxidants have been shown to be effective against these conditions. The effectiveness of garlic in these disease states could be due to its ability to scavenge OFRs. However, the OFR-scavenging activity of garlic is not known. Also it is not known if its activity is affected by cooking. We therefore investigated, using high pressure liquid chromatography, the ability of garlic extract (heated or unheated) to scavenge exogenously generated hydroxyl radical (.OH). .OH was generated by photolysis of H2O2 (1.2-10 mumoles/ml) with ultraviolet (UV) light and was trapped with salicylic acid (500 nmoles/ml). H2O2 produced .OH in a concentration-dependent manner as estimated by .OH adduct products 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) and 2,5-DHBA. Garlic extract (5-100 microliters/ml) produced an inhibition (30-100%) of 2,3-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA generated by photolysis of H2O2 (5.00 pmoles/ml) in a concentration-dependent manner. Its activity is reduced by 10% approximately when heated to 100 degrees C for 20, 40 or 60 min. The extent of reduction in activity was similar for the three heating periods. Garlic extract prevented the .OH-induced formation of malondialdehyde in the rabbit liver homogenate in a concentration-dependent manner. It alone did not affect the MDA levels in the absence of .OH. These results indicate that garlic extract is a powerful scavenger of .OH and that heating reduces its activity slightly.",Molecular and cellular biochemistry,"['D000818', 'D002851', 'D016166', 'D005737', 'D005841', 'D006358', 'D062385', 'D017665', 'D015227', 'D008099', 'D008315', 'D010782', 'D010936', 'D010946', 'D011817', 'D012459', 'D020156', 'D012680', 'D013481', 'D014466']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'Garlic', 'Gentisates', 'Hot Temperature', 'Hydroxybenzoates', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Liver', 'Malondialdehyde', 'Photolysis', 'Plant Extracts', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Rabbits', 'Salicylates', 'Salicylic Acid', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Superoxides', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",Evaluation of hydroxyl radical-scavenging property of garlic.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000494', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000302', None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'analysis', None, 'pharmacology', None, None, None, None, None, 'isolation & purification', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8717417,1996,,,,,

8870956,"N-Acetyl-S-allyl-L-cysteine (allylmercapturic acid, ALMA) was previously detected in urine from humans consuming garlic. Exposure of rats to allyl halides is also known to lead to excretion of ALMA in urine. ALMA is a potential biomarker for exposure assessment of workers exposed to allyl halides. It is not known whether garlic consumption can lead to urinary concentrations of ALMA which may interfere with biological monitoring of exposure to allyl halides by determination of urinary ALMA. Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine the cumulative excretion and the excretion kinetics of ALMA in urine of humans consuming garlic. Six human volunteers were given orally two garlic tablets, each containing 100 mg garlic extract (each representing 300 mg fresh garlic). Three of the volunteers consumed additional garlic after the garlic tablet intake. Urine samples were collected up to 24 h after the intake of the garlic tablets. ALMA was identified in the urine using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and determined quantitatively with a limit of detection of 0.10 microgram/ml with gas chromatography with sulphur selective detection. The total amount of ALMA found in urine of volunteers who consumed two garlic tablets was 0.43 +/- 0.14 mg (n = 3). In the urine of the three volunteers who consumed not only two garlic tablets but also additional fresh garlic, a significantly higher amount of ALMA was excreted in the urine, 1.4 +/- 0.2 mg (n = 3). The elimination half-life of ALMA, estimated from urinary excretion rate versus time curves, was 6.0 +/- 1.3 h (n = 5). One volunteer, who ate additional garlic, showed an irregular elimination profile and was excluded from this estimation. The highest urinary concentration of ALMA found in this study was 2.2 micrograms/ml. In a preliminary biological monitoring study of exposure in workers with potential exposure to allyl chloride (AC) up to the occupational exposure limit of 1 ppm (8-h TWA), we recently found urinary ALMA concentrations up to 4 micrograms/ml. Based on the results presented here, we conclude that garlic consumption is a potential confounder when monitoring human exposure to allylhalides and other chemicals leading to ALMA excretion when ALMA is used as a biomarker of exposure.",Archives of toxicology,"['D000111', 'D000284', 'D000328', 'D005260', 'D005737', 'D006801', 'D008297', 'D008991', 'D010946']","['Acetylcysteine', 'Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Garlic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Plants, Medicinal']",Urinary excretion of N-acetyl-S-allyl-L-cysteine upon garlic consumption by human volunteers.,"['Q000031', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","['analogs & derivatives', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8870956,1997,,,,,
8806047,"Diallyl sulfone (DASO2) is a metabolite of diallyl sulfide, a compound derived from garlic. The present study investigated the effect of DASO2 as a protective agent against acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. Oral administration of DASO2 protected mice against the APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. When administered 1 hour prior to, immediately after, or 20 minutes after a toxic dose of APAP, DASO2 at a dose of 25 mg/kg completely protected mice from development of hepatotoxicity, as indicated by liver histopathology and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels. Protective effect was observed when DASO2 at a dose as low as 5 mg/kg was given to mice 1 hour prior to APAP administration. Oral administration of DASO2 to mice 1 hour prior to a toxic dose of APAP significantly inhibited the APAP-induced glutathione depletion in the liver. DASO2 treatment also decreased the levels of oxidative APAP metabolites in the plasma without affecting the concentrations of nonoxidative APAP metabolites. In liver microsomes, 0.1 mM of DASO2 caused a 60% decrease in the rate of APAP oxidation to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, which was determined as glutathione conjugate. This inhibitory effect is mainly due to its inhibition of cytochrome P450 2E1 activity; with an IC50 value equal to 0.11 mM. DASO2 also slightly inhibited the activities of P450s 3A and 1A, with IC50 values > 5 mM. Furthermore, a single oral dose of DASO2 inactivated P450 2E1- and P450 1A-dependent activities in liver microsomes. The results suggest that the protective effect of DASO2 against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity is due to its ability to block acetaminophen bioactivation mainly by the inactivation and inhibition of P450 2E1.",Journal of biochemical toxicology,"['D000082', 'D000284', 'D000498', 'D018712', 'D000818', 'D016227', 'D002851', 'D065691', 'D004305', 'D005978', 'D007097', 'D066298', 'D007770', 'D008099', 'D008297', 'D051379', 'D008862', 'D010084', 'D013450']","['Acetaminophen', 'Administration, Oral', 'Allyl Compounds', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic', 'Animals', 'Benzoquinones', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutathione', 'Imines', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microsomes, Liver', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Sulfones']",Protective effect of diallyl sulfone against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in mice.,"['Q000008', None, 'Q000008', 'Q000008', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000097', 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000187', None, 'Q000008']","['administration & dosage', None, 'administration & dosage', 'administration & dosage', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'blood', 'drug effects', None, None, 'drug effects', None, 'administration & dosage']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8806047,1997,,,,,
8759327,"We present an overview of the development and use of our selected-ion flow tube (SIFT) technique as a sensitive, quantitative method for the rapid, real-time analysis of the trace gas content of atmospheric air and human breath, presenting some pilot data from various research areas in which this method will find valuable application. We show that it is capable of detecting and quantifying trace gases, in complex mixtures such as breath, which are present at partial pressures down to about 10 parts per billion. Following discussions of the principles involved in this SIFT method of analysis, of the experiments which we have carried out to establish its quantitative validity, and of the air and breath sampling techniques involved, we present sample data on the detection and quantification of trace gases on the breath of healthy people and of patients suffering from renal failure and diabetes. We also show how breath ammonia can be accurately quantified from a single breath exhalation and used as an indicator of the presence in the stomach of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. Health and safety applications are exemplified by analyses of the gases of the gases of cigarette smoke and on the breath of smokers. The value of this analytical method in environmental science is demonstrated by the analyses of petrol vapour, car exhaust emissions and the trace organic vapours detected in town air near a busy road. Final examples of the value of this analytical method are the detection and quantification of the gases emitted from crushed garlic and from breath following the chewing of a mint, which demonstrate its potential in food and flavour research. Throughout the paper we stress the advantages of this SIFT method compared to conventional mass spectrometry for trace gas analysis of complex mixtures, emphasizing its selectivity, sensitivity and real-time analysis capability. Finally, we note that whilst the current SIFT is strictly laboratory based, both transportable and portable instruments are under construction and development.

Compositional analysis of the oligosaccharide units after digestion with an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from Streptomyces indicated that the polysaccharides were constructed of four kinds of repeating oligosaccharide unit, namely, a decasaccharide (glucose/xylose/galactose/fucose, 4 : 3: 2 : 1), a nonasaccharide (glucose/xylose/galactose/fucose, 4 : 3 : 1 : 1), an octasaccharide (glucose/xylose/galactose, 4 : 3 : 1), and a heptasaccharide (glucose/xylose, 4 : 3). The xyloglucan from the hybrid contained highly fucosylated units that resembled those from onion rather than from garlic.

7979352,"The garlic plant (Allium sativum) alliinase (EC 4.4.1.4), which catalyzes the synthesis of allicin, was purified to homogeneity from bulbs using various steps, including hydrophobic chromatography. Molecular and biochemical studies showed that the enzyme is a dimer of two subunits of MW 51.5 kDa each. Its Km using synthetic S-allylcysteine sulfoxide (+ isomer) as substrate was 1.1 mM, its pH optimum 6.5, and its isoelectric point 6.35. The enzyme is a glycoprotein containing 6% carbohydrate. N-terminal sequences of the intact polypeptide chain as well as of a number of peptides obtained after cyanogen bromide cleavage were obtained. Cloning of the cDNAs encoding alliinase was performed by a two-step strategy. In the first, a cDNA fragment (pAli-1-450 bp) was obtained by PCR using a mixed oligonucleotide primer synthesized according to a 6-amino acid segment near the N-terminal of the intact polypeptide. The second step involved screening of garlic lambda gt11 and lambda ZAPII cDNA libraries with pAli-1, which yielded two clones; one was nearly full length and the second was full length. These clones exhibited some degree of DNA sequence divergence, especially in their 3' noncoding regions, suggesting that they were encoded by separate genes. The nearly full length cDNA was fused in frame to a DNA encoding a signal peptide from alpha wheat gliadin, and expressed in Xenopus oocytes. This yielded a 50 kDa protein that interacted with the antibodies against natural bulb alliinase. Northern and Western blot analyses showed that the bulb alliinase was highly expressed in bulbs, whereas a lower expression level was found in leaves, and no expression was detected in roots. Strikingly, the roots exhibited an abundant alliinase activity, suggesting that this tissue expressed a distinct alliinase isozyme with very low homology to the bulb enzyme.",Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,"['D000595', 'D000818', 'D001483', 'D015153', 'D013437', 'D002851', 'D003001', 'D003488', 'D003545', 'D018076', 'D005260', 'D005737', 'D005786', 'D006863', 'D066298', 'D007525', 'D008969', 'D008970', 'D009693', 'D010946', 'D016133', 'D011108', 'D012333', 'D011817', 'D013441', 'D014982']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carbon-Sulfur Lyases', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyanogen Bromide', 'Cysteine', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Female', 'Garlic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymers', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rabbits', 'Sulfinic Acids', 'Xenopus laevis']",Alliin lyase (Alliinase) from garlic (Allium sativum).

The measured activity was referred to 35S-alliin (35S-alliin equivalents). The blood activity levels in each group were monitored for 72 h. For 35S-allicin and the labeled vinyldithiines the excretion with the urine, feces, and exhaled air was also measured. The distribution among the organs (whole-body autoradiography) and the urinary metabolite pattern (thin-layer chromatography) were also determined. For 35S-alliin the blood activity profile differed considerably from those of 35S-allicin and the labeled vinyldithiines: both the absorption and the elimination of the radioactivity were distinctly faster than for the other garlic constituents, maximum blood levels being reached within the first 10 min and elimination from the blood being almost complete after 6 h. For the other garlic constituents the maximum blood levels were not reached until 30-60 min (35S-allicin) or 120 min (vinyldithiines) p.a. and blood levels > 1000 ng-Eq/ml were still present at the end of the study after 72 h. The mean total urinary and fecal excretion after 72 h was 85.5% (35S-allicin) or 92.3% (labeled vinyldithiines) of the dose. The urinary excretion indicates a minimum absorption rate of 65% (35S-allicin) or 73% (vinyldithiines). It is uncertain whether the 19-21% recovered in the feces was unabsorbed substance or had been excreted via the bile or intestinal mucosa. The exhaled air showed only traces of activity although the whole-body autoradiographs, after fairly long exposure (96 h), showed distinct enrichment of activity in the mucosa of the airways and pharynx. The activity is deposite mainly in the cartilage of the vertebral column and ribs. There was no detectable difference in organ distribution between 35S-allicin and the labeled vinyldithiines. All that could be established from the urinary metabolite pattern was that unchanged 35S-allicin and unchanged labeled vinyldithiines are absent. There is therefore extensive metabolization. The metabolites must have a very polar structure with acid functional groups since satisfactory separation was achievable only with acid solvent systems. Conjugates with sulfuric or glucuronic acid were not detectable. These results reveal no differences in pharmacokinetic behavior between 35S-allicin and the labeled vinyldithiines.

Comparative values are given from a background area, namely a domestic garden located in the North Yorkshire Dales National Park area. Analysis was undertaken by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma-source mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with quality control assessment using four international biological reference materials; BCR:CRM 62 Olive Leaves, NIST 1575 Pine Needles, NIST 1573 Tomato Leaves, and NIST 1572 Citrus Leaves. Inter-analytical method comparison is given using two methods of ICP-MS; namely conventional pneumatic nebulisation of sample solution, and direct solids analysis by laser ablation; and neutron activation analysis methods (NAA). For the elements listed there is a good precision obtained by ICP-MS and NAA. In particular levels of < +/- 1-10% (rsd) are obtained. Comparison of data with certified values and other analytical methods are generally of very good agreement. Lead levels in background areas ranged from 0.0008 to 0.340 microgram/g (fresh weight) for plant material; with the lead magnitude greater for grasses > herbs > vegetables > cereals > fruits. Measured values are in good agreement with reported literature values. The lowest Pb values are for marrow, lettuce, tomato and sweet corn samples (approximately 0.001-0.021 microgram/g). 'Green' leaf material levels were approximately 0.02-0.10 microgram/g (i.e. sprouts and cabbage). Root vegetables contain higher levels, approximately 0.02-0.125 microgram/g (especially carrot), reflecting possible metal uptake from soil. The highest vegetable Pb values are for leek and onion (approximately 0.35 microgram/g).

8223549,"Lectin cDNA clones encoding the two mannose-binding lectins from ramsons (allium ursinum L.) bulbs, AUAI and AUAII (AUA, Allium ursinum agglutinin), were isolated and characterized. Sequence comparison of the different cDNA clones isolated revealed three types of lectin clones called LECAUAG0, LECAUAG1 and LECAUAG2, which besides the obvious differences in their sequences also differ from each other in the number of potential glycosylation sites within the C-terminal peptide of the lectin precursor. In vivo biosynthesis studies of the ramson lectins have shown that glycosylated lectin precursors occur in the organelle fraction of radioactively labeled ramson bulbs. Despite the similarities between the A. ursinum and the A. sativum (garlic) lectins at the protein level, molecular cloning of the two ramson lectins has shown that the lectin genes in A. ursinum are organized differently. Whereas in A. sativum the lectin polypeptides of the heterodimeric ASAI are encoded by one large precursor, those of the heterodimeric AUAI lectin are derived from two different precursors. These results are confirmed by Northern blot hybridization of A. ursinum RNA which, after hybridization with a labeled lectin cDNA, reveals only one band of 800 nucleotides in contrast to A. sativum RNA which yields two bands of 1400 and 800 nucleotides.

1516037,"N-Nitroso compounds (NOCs) are known to be strong carcinogens in various animals including primates (Preussman and Stewart, (1984) N-Nitroso Compounds). Human exposure to these compounds can be by ingestion or inhalation of preformed NOCs or by endogenous nitrosation from naturally occurring precursors (Bartsch and Montesano, Carcinogenesis, 5 (1984) 1381-1393; Tannebaum (1979) Naturally Occuring Carcinogens, Mutagens and Modulators of Carcinogenesis; Shephard et al., Food Chem. Toxicol., 25 (1987) 91-108). Several factors present in the diet can modify levels of endogenously formed nitrosamines by acting as catalysts or inhibitors. Compounds in the human diet that alter nitrosamine formation would thus play an important role in carcinogenesis study. Earlier researchers have reported the nitrite scavenging nature of sulphydryl compounds (Williams, Chem. Soc. Rev., 15 (1983) 171-196). We therefore studied the modifying effect of sulphydryl compounds viz., cysteine (CE), cystine (CI), glutathione (GU), cysteamine (CEA), cystamine (CEI), cysteic acid (CIA) and thioglycolic acid (TGA) on the nitrosation of model amines viz., pyrrolidine (PYR), piperidine (NPIP) and morpholine (NMOR).

Both onion and garlic are known to contain sulphur compounds (Block, Sci. Am., 252 (1985) 114-119).

552092,"Oral administration of onion and garlic reportedly decreases platelet aggregation in both human and animal subjects. An oily chloroform extract of onion (Allium Cepa) was prepared and separated by column chromatography on silicic acid into six fractions by elution with solvents of increasing polarity. The least polar fraction contained most of the inhibitory activity towards platelet aggregation induced by either ADP or arachidonic acid. Further purification was afforded by thin-layer chromatography. The specific activity of this major active fraction (I50 per ml of PRP) was approximately 7 units per milligram. Platelets incubated in the presence of onion inhibitor and (1-14C)-arachidonic acid showed striking changes in the pattern of arachidonic acid metabolites formed. Thromboxane B2 synthesis was almost completely suppressed without significant decreases in total hydroxy fatty acid formation. It was concluded that the observed antiplatelet activity of onion relates to the presence of a non-polar, heat stable inhibitor of thromboxane synthesis.

A trace of L-rhamnose was also detected in the polysaccharide hydrolyzate. The pectic acid was partially removed by precipitation with aqueous calcium chloride; from the remaining polysaccharide mixture, a pure D-galactan containing 97.3% of D-galactose was isolated by fractional precipitation and repeated chromatography through a column of DEAE-cellulose. Methanolysis and hydrolysis of the permethylated D-galactan yielded 2,3,4,6-tetra-, 2,3,6-tri-, and 2,3,di-O-methyl-D-galactose in the molar proportions of 1:2:1. On periodate oxidation, the D-galactan reduced 1.18 molar equivalents of the oxidant per D-galactosyl residue, and liberated one molar equivalent of formic acid per 4.13 D-galactosyl residues.

The enzyme was unstable to storage at -10 degrees , particularly in dilute concentrations, but the addition of glycerol (final concentration 10%, v/v) stabilized the activity completely for at least 30 days. 2. The purified enzyme had an optimum pH for activity at 6.5. The addition of pyridoxal phosphate stimulated the reaction rate and the stimulation became more marked as the purification proceeded. 3. Hydroxylamine (10mum) and cysteine (0.5mm) inhibited the enzyme activity by more than 80%. Spectral studies indicated that cysteine reacted with pyridoxal phosphate bound to the protein. 4. The K(m) values for S-methyl-, S-ethyl-, S-propyl-, S-butyl- and S-allyl-l-cysteine sulphoxides were determined. With S-allyl-l-cysteine sulphoxide the K(m) was 6mm and the V(max.) was greater than those with the other substrates tested. 5. The thioether analogues of the substrates were competitive inhibitors for the lyase reaction. The K(i) decreased with increasing chain length of the alkyl substituent. With S-ethyl-l-cysteine sulphoxide as substrate the K(i) was 33, 8 and 5mm respectively for S-methyl-, S-ethyl- and S-propyl-l-cysteine. 6. The addition of EDTA or Mg(2+), Mn(2+), Co(2+) or Fe(2+) stimulated the reaction rate. Other bivalent cations either had no effect or gave a strong inhibition.
